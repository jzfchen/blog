### Preface

In December 2023, I will graduate medical school, marking the end of a 20 year journey through the Australian education system. While I am itching to finally join the workforce as my schoolmates have years prior, I'm sure I will look back on my years in schooling fondly.

Welcome to **'Lessons from Medical School'**, a series of essays that delves into the rollecoaster ride of my journey through the world of medicine. From studying hacks to sobering realities, join me as I unravel the insights, humour, and heart that comes with being a medical student. 

These are the lessons that the textbooks don't teach, and the stories that defined my path to becoming a doctor.

# LFMS #1: You're Not That Guy

Can you remember how you felt on the first day of kindergarten? 

What about primary school, high-school, and university?

A fundamental tenet of education is progression, and with progression comes being humbled. 

Every six years or so, just as you've climbed to the top of the social and academic hierarchy, you experience an ungracious tumble back to the bottom of the pecking order.

Most want to advance in their budding careers, cultivating the marks, experiences, connections needed to make it to that next elusive level. As you ascend each rung of the ladder, you’ll encounter fiercer competition, as the applicants become increasingly competent. 

But slowly and surely, you make your way up Mount Education, until you finally cross the finish line and polish off the first major chapter of your life. 

## The Pokemon Analogy

I’d like to (very poorly and unnecessarily) analogise this journey to Pokémon. 

Starting primary is like choosing your starter Pokemon. You are taught the basics, with your teacher/Professor Oak holding your hand the whole way. 

Next comes high school. You finally step out of Pallet Town, ready to take on everyone and everything in your way! But you have a Level 7 Charmander (Year 7 reading comprehension). And you have a lot of unskippable cutscenes to sit through.

University is like battling the eight gym leaders, each posing successively more difficult challenges. The students (trainers) you meet along the way become stronger too.

Some breeze through stage just like they had the last. Some pour in hours and hours into study just to keep up with their colleagues. Some decide, often for reasons outside their control, that they've had enough, and leaev altogether.

But most persevere, and with some determination - and many, many cups of coffee - become a productive member of society (Pokemon Champion? I warned you this analogy was bad).

## Pokémon - Medical School Edition

That was my experience up until my Bachelor’s degree at least. 

Entering medical school was completely different. At every advancement of schooling I had felt somewhat prepared to take on the challenges of the next stage.

In all honesty I thought I would be prepared for medicine too. Could it really be that different?

### A New Start

Our faculty decided that they would shake things up, with our cohort being the first year of the **‘New Program’** (which, in retrospect, could have easily been something straight out of _‘Nineteen Eighty-Four’_ or one of Stalin’s campaigns). 

There were good intentions underlying this change; we would have a whole extra year of clinical experience, taking histories, doing examinations, performing procedures! Unfortunately, just like the _Monro-Kellie_ doctrine (sorry), something had to give. 

In this case it meant that the two years we previously had to study all of anatomy, physiology, pathology, pharmacology, microbiology, and the management of most common ailments was condensed into a measly _10_ months. 

And who could forget that **pesky virus** - stories about which I will save for another day...

### Back to Pokémon

So what does medical school have in common with Pokemon, you ask? 

Instead of selecting a spirited Squirtle to start, they had instead given us some pointy sticks and dropped us in front of the Elite Four entrance to fend for ourselves. When accounting for an unprecedented **global pandemic**, it was like the whole building was on fire too.

“Don’t worry about learning it all,” they told us, when met with complaints about the excessive workload, “you will cover it again in the next three years.”

To the horde of _ex-star_ students, many of whom had never failed an exam in their lives, this was not a satisfactory answer. I, for one, had spent most of my undergraduate days attempting to memorise every silly fact that popped up on the lecture slides. 

On top of the coursework, we were expected to attend hospital once a week, to develop a mastery of clinical examination and history taking. 

This **obviously did not** happen in a year (or four years, if I might add). 

Being complete newbies in the hospital, everyone is bound to experience some cringe-worthy moments, the type that strike you years later as you're drifting off to sleep. 

### (Not) Saved by the Bell

One particularly embarrassing moment from my cardiology tutorials comes to mind. As part of the cardiac examination, I would listen methodically to the beating of the heart; first using the wider end of the stethoscope (the diaphragm), then turning it around to auscultate with the narrower end (the bell). 

In theory, this end would allow me to hear the lower-pitched heart sounds. I would listen intently, nodding my head and furrowing my brow as if I were deep in thought, then confidently announce that there were no abnormal murmurs.

Imagine my surprise when I was told that you had to **physically rotate the head of the stethoscope** to activate the bell! I may as well have been listening to the patient's big toe!

> "You know you have to flip it right..."

Surely the tutors and other group members knew and were seeing how long it would take me to realise...

## Final Words

Looking back, I had no idea what I was doing. To be frank, I was fairly confident no-one else did either, which brought me a tiny bit of relief. 

Does this mean that every aspiring medical student is going to have a hard time?

Of course not! I’m sure there are those that have blitzed through medical school with their Level 100 Charizard.

But remember, it's not about being **_'that guy/girl'_**; it's about becoming the **best version of yourself**. Embrace the lessons along the way, and let your experiences and setbacks shape you into a doctor with a unique and powerful story to tell. 

So as far as I'm concerned, everyone who makes it through this journey is 'that guy/girl'. 
Congratulations on wherever you are in your journey. Your younger self would be proud of you.
