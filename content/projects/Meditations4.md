## Day 15 04/02/24

### Statement 4.12

> Two kinds of readiness are constantly needed: (i) to do only what the logos of authority and law directs, with the good of human beings in mind; (ii) to reconsider your position, when someone can set you straight or convert you to his. But your conversion should always rest on a conviction that it’s right, or benefits others—nothing else. Not because it’s more appealing or more popular. 

The first is obvious and common sense to those who want to do good. Who thinks they are not doing good? The second is less obvious. To live this way is not to be stubborn in your own ways and not be able to be convinced by others. Instead it is to consider the value of another’s position. Your fellow man or woman’s opinion has just as much validity as yours, you should be open to this fact. Be as open to conversion to their way of thinking as you hope others will be to yours. But if you are to be converted, you must genuinely believe it is right, and have good evidence for this. For to be converted to something you do not believe is to say your soul is weak, that the foundation you base your current beliefs on was shaky in the first place. On a basic level, does their way of thinking benefit the world? Does it align with your virtues? If so then be convinced. Do not let how other people perceive you alter your likelihood of acceptance. 

### Statement 4.13

> You have a mind? 
—Yes.Well, why not use it? Isn’t that all you want—for it to do its job? 

To go a day without using the mind that defines our species is to waste what it means to be human. This applies intellectually, emotionally, spiritually. Let your mind work.

## Day 16 05/02/24

### Statement 4.15 

> Many lumps of incense on the same altar. One crumbles now, one later, but it makes no difference. 

My understanding on this is that we are all people on the same Earth. Some fall, either by dying physically or degrading themselves mentally and spiritually, however our time in this world is limited. To the person who comes to clean up the incense the next day, he sees the same thing, not how long each one has lasted, or what each one has achieved, but simply all lying extinguished and crumbled. Don’t wait for things to happen, and don’t lament if bad things come to you that haven’t to others. We are all destined for the same thing.

### Statement 4.17

> Not to live as if you had endless years ahead of you. Death overshadows you. While you’re alive and able—be good. 

Similar to the above. Live in the present, don’t assume you have time later. We will all die. Make every moment of life count. (Note: Marcus must have been going through some shit because the next half of this book is all about mortality).

## Day 16 06/02/24

### Statement 4.18
> The tranquillity that comes when you stop caring what they say. Or think, or do. Only what you do. Not to be distracted by their darkness. To run straight for the finish line, unswerving. 

A repetition of previous statements but worth mentioning. Stop caring about what others think. Define your own virtues and live by them. Don’t care how they act towards themselves, towards others, or towards you. Know your own goals.

### Statement 4.19
>People who are excited by posthumous fame forget that the people who remember them will soon die too. And those after them in turn. Until their memory, passed from one to another like a candle flame, gutters and goes out. 
But suppose that those who remembered you were immortal and your memory undying. What good would it do you? And I don’t just mean when you’re dead, but in your own lifetime. What use is praise, except to make your lifestyle a little more comfortable? 

Why do we want praise, glory, recognition. What is the point of legacy? Hold this question in your mind when you find your ambitions growing too large. Is leaving something behind that grows beyond the limits of your life and the ones you love actually worth it? Or is that just your ego and desire to be great speaking?

## Day 17 07/02/24

### Statement 4.20
>Beautiful things of any kind are beautiful in themselves and sufficient to themselves. Praise is extraneous. The object of praise remains what it was—no better and no worse. This applies, I think, even to “beautiful” things in ordinary life—physical objects, artworks. Does anything genuinely beautiful need supplementing? No more than justice does—or truth, or kindness, or humility. Are any of those improved by being praised? Or damaged by contempt? Is an emerald suddenly flawed if no one admires it? 

You don’t need to be appreciated to have value. Just because noone sees it doesn’t mean it is good. Anything genuinely beautiful doesn’t need to be praised. Live your life like this too. Don’t do something good just to obtain praise - if losing the praise means that you wouldn’t do it, did you really have good intentions in mind? Do things because they are good, not to be recognised as good.

## Day 18 08/02/24

### Statement 4.22

>Not to be driven this way and that, but always to behave with justice and see things as they are. 

A concept repeated many times but a reminder for me for today. Don’t worry about what other people say or think. If you are wrong you are wrong, if you are right you are right. See yourself with a true and critical eye, but do not let the opinions of others be the main driving force but rather a guiding one. Other people can help you see the flaws and perks of your ways, but you should not act only in interest of their approval.

### Statement 4.24
>“If you seek tranquillity, do less.” Or (more accurately) do what’s essential—what the logos of a social being requires, and in the requisite way. Which brings a double satisfaction: to do less, better. 
Because most of what we say and do is not essential. If you can eliminate it, you’ll have more time, and more tranquillity. Ask yourself at 
every moment, “Is this necessary?”But we need to eliminate unnecessary assumptions as well. To eliminate 
the unnecessary actions that follow. 

Marcus Aurelius claims that peace can be attained by doing less. A lot of what we do is truly not essential. Figure out what you need in your life and what is important and virtuous to you. Then remove the extraneous things. Do you really need to spend 30 minutes on your phone scrolling TikTok? Do you need to reply to that email now? Cutting out things that don’t bring you extra satisfaction or act for the common good can bring some tranquility. In a way Marcus is advocating for the original minimalist mindset. 

## Day 19 09/02/24

### Statement 4.26
>Don’t be disturbed. Uncomplicate yourself.Someone has done wrong . . . to himself.Something happens to you. Good. It was meant for you by nature, 
woven into the pattern from the beginning.
If something happens to you, someone wrongs you, do not look to curse that person. They are degrading only themselves unless you let them degrade you. If you truly believe what you are doing is good, and have evaluated yourself from within, why should you worry what others do to themselves and to you? What is out of your control is out of your control. Why spend energy dealing with things you had no say in in the first place? Focus instead on the things you can change, notably your response to challenging times. Don’t be caught criticising or complaining about others.



## Day 20 10/02/24

### Statement 4.28
>Character: dark, womanish, obstinate. Wolf, sheep, child, fool, cheat, buffoon, salesman, tyrant. 

I don’t get it but put it in cause it sounds funny

### Statement 4.31
>Love the discipline you know, and let it support you. Entrust everything willingly to the gods, and then make your way through life—no one’s master and no one’s slave. 

Marcus is saying to trust noone but discipline, let it be your guide. The rest you can leave to fate - you have already controlled everything in your own power, done everything that you can control through discipline. You are not controlled by anyone because you have controlled yourself.

## Day 21 11/02/24

### Statement 4.33

>Everything fades so quickly, turns into legend, and soon oblivion covers it. 
And those are the ones who shone. The rest—“unknown, unasked-for” a minute after death. What is “eternal” fame? Emptiness. 
Then what should we work for? 
Only this: proper understanding; unselfish action; truthful speech. A resolve to accept whatever happens as necessary and familiar, flowing like water from that same source and spring. 

Marcus reflects upon the names of all the famous senators and emperors who came before him. He reflects on the fleeting nature of their times on Earth; they were so powerful but once it is all gone it feels empty. So what is important if not leaving a legacy? Simply seeking to understand truth, live life as it comes, accepting the way things have to be, like drinking from a spring. Living a true and genuine life while you have it, rather than looking too far into the future and thinking about what legacy you should leave.
