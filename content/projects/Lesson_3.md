The first time I met Haniya her eyes were rolled back in her head and her arms lay lifelessly by her side. Seconds later, she sat up slowly and rubbed her eyes groggily, as if waking from a nap that had gone on too long. Initially confused, an innocent smile spread slowly across her face as she recognised her parents and the medical team surrounding her hospital bed.

Haniya was a eight-year old from regional NSW who had been admitted to the children’s hospital in Sydney to determine the cause of these episodes of unconsciousness. They had begun two weeks earlier, and would happen every ten to twenty minutes, causing her to suddenly fall backwards and lose voluntary control for anywhere between ten seconds and a minute. Colloquially dubbed ‘drop seizures’ and more formally known as ‘atonic seizures’, the team reassured her parents that they were likely due to disorganised electrical activity in her brain, a condition referred to as epilepsy. 

At the time I was a third year medical student on my first full-time hospital placement. Starved of attention from the doctors and preoccupied with thoughts of nothing but what I would have for lunch, I caught Haniya’s playful gaze. As the grown-ups talked, I walked over to her bedside and introduced myself. 

“I’m Jackson, the medical student on the team…”. I started off on the rehearsed preamble that I tended to mindlessly deliver to any patient. 

“Do you like drawing?”, she interrupted sharply, as if to remind me that she was a eight-year old and not the usual geriatric inpatient I had grown used to. 

She motioned to the scrap of paper she had been doodling on before her last seizure. On it were three figures labelled “Me, Mum, and Dad”, crudely sketched with a hospital-branded pen. She had drawn her father with an unusually large head and a crooked back, which I found myself chuckling at. 

“I do like drawing”, I replied, “but I’m not very good at it”. 

“I’ll teach you.” Haniya tore off a scrap from her notebook and placed it in my hands.

I would soon grow to love those ward rounds. Kids behave differently to adults when they are sick. While most elderly inpatients tend to sit in their chairs sullenly, nod their heads rhythmically at treatment plans they don’t understand, it was not uncommon to see children running around the ward screaming during our daily review of patients. 

They know, of course, that there is something not quite right with them. Perhaps it is because they don’t understand illness, death, and its implications. But it certainly does not stop them from having a good time. 

Haniya was always the last patient on the long list, and always my favourite to see. 

I noticed she was the only child that would not be constantly using some sort of electronic device; when she wasn’t drawing she was reading, and when she wasn’t reading she was chatting away to her much more worried-looking parents. 

When our team walked into her room each day she would squeal my name in delight. I remember trying to maintain the steadfast composure we are taught to have as medical professionals, but feeling happy that a patient was actually excited to see me for once. 

As I sat down with her and she began her daily ritual of showing me the previous day’s drawings, I listened to the conversation the doctors were having with her parents. Haniya’s seizures were becoming more frequent and lasting longer. Brain scans showed no tumour, to her parent’s relief, but the pattern of electrical activity during her seizures was not consistent with the forms of epilepsy that occurred in children.

My job was to administer a daily test known as an ‘Mini Mental State Examination’ to see if the condition causing her worsening seizures was causing her cognition to deteriorate. I would turn the tasks into a game, who could spell “WORLD” backwards the quickest, who could count backwards from 100 in 7s most accurately. 

It took time to get used to the seizures that would occasionally interrupt our conversations, but soon they became part of our routine. She would have no recollection of them happening. I knew when she had regained full consciousness when her radiant smile reappeared on her face, picking up on the conversation as if nothing had happened. 

Her parents told me that this was the highlight of her day, and frankly, it was the highlight of mine.

It was clear Haniya was exceptionally bright for her age. Her parents were Pakistani immigrants with strong educational backgrounds. Her father, Rahim, was an electrical engineer. Her mother, Mariam, was pursuing a PhD in Economics. They had put their careers on indefinite hold to care for Haniya for the weeks she was in Sydney.

Haniya was the spitting image of her mother, both had shoulder-length dark brown hair, olive skin, and strong facial features. Her hair was often done up in a braid or a ponytail, which her mother would do every morning. She told me she wanted to look like a mermaid - she had recently watched Disney’s ‘The Little Mermaid’ on the tiny TV box that each child’s bed comes equipped with. I smiled at the idea that kids were still watching the same classic films that I hold so fondly in my memory.

In retrospect, I had only gotten to know Haniya and her parents for two weeks before that day, although with the busy life of the hospital it felt like much longer than that. 

I remember trudging into the ward after my 75 minute commute to the hospital. I may have been dreaming it, but the mood seemed unusually solemn, the usual chatter that filled the doctor’s room was replaced by a silence uncharacteristic of a busy hospital. As usual, I swiped my card to log onto the computer and began reviewing Haniya’s notes from the previous night.

“Measles IgG elevated in CSF, likely to be SSPE,” the registrar’s note read, “To discuss with parents tomorrow.”

I had not come across the condition before. In medicine this is usually not a good thing. Rare conditions are often less studied and often carry a worse prognosis. 

A Google search confirmed my fears:

“Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a very rare, but fatal disease of the central nervous system that results from a measles virus infection acquired earlier in life”. 

Measles has been virtually non-existent in Australia since 2014, thanks to the national rollout of vaccinations against the virus starting in 1992. Haniya was born in Pakistan, a country in which measles is endemic and many young children remain unimmunised. She was one of nearly 10,000 children who catch measles every year in the country. Of these children, she represented one of the 2 in 10,000 who will eventually develop SSPE, a delayed reaction to the measles virus which lies latent in the brain. 

In an act of what can only be described as denial, I searched up every web source I could find on SSPE. 

All relayed the same grim message - the sufferer experiences a slow deterioration in brain function, starting with seizures, progressing to behaviour changes, loss of vision and movement, and inevitably, death.

I didn’t go on the ward round that day. I didn’t know how to feel, to act in front of the team and the other patients. I couldn’t bear to face Haniya and her parents; to be armed with the devastating news that she and her parents were likely not aware of yet.

I felt ashamed. She wasn’t my child. She wasn’t my patient. I felt like a coward for being unable to face the looming death of someone I had only known for two weeks, while her parents would have to endure this pain for the rest of their lives. 

After the round I asked to speak with the registrar, Charlotte. She was heavily pregnant, far too pregnant to still be spending over 16 hours at the hospital every day. We spoke about the medical technicalities of the disease, the pathogenesis, the symptoms, the prognosis. Our discussion shifted to Haniya’s family; there was a family meeting scheduled for that afternoon, the family had not been informed yet. A wave of newfound respect for Charlotte swept over me as I noticed her subtle aura of wistfulness, carefully veiled in professional composure. As an expecting mother and the doctor responsible for breaking the news to Rahim and Mariam that their beloved daughter would not live to grow old, she faced a task that I could not even dream of approaching. Despite being only a few years my senior, I suddenly realised how large a gap in professional and emotional competence there was between us. 

Her pager went off, she mumbled a quiet apology and left to attend her clinical duties. 

—-—-—-—-—-—-—-—-—-—-—-—-—-—-—-—-—-—-—-—-—-—-—-—-—-—-—-—-—-

Haniya’s parents asked for her to be excluded from the family meeting, perhaps sensing that the subject matter would not be appropriate for the eight year-old. I was asked to supervise Haniya during this time. 

Haniya had just come back from one of the weekly parties held by the hospital’s associated charity foundation. On her head was a paper tiara, with haphazardly scattered glitter stuck to it, and she sported a purple tutu. Despite the chaos in my mind, I couldn’t help but feel enveloped by her warmth and excitement, and we soon settled into our usual routine.

She had been watching an animated movie which I did not recognise at the time (I now know it to be “Norm of the North”). The plot follows an anthropomorphic polar bear named Norm who is kidnapped and taken to New York City and faces off against a greedy developer. There was an unsettling yet almost humorous dissonance in knowing I was watching a cartoon while her parents were receiving the news of their daughter’s terminal illness.

Haniya turned away from the movie and motioned with her hands to grab my attention.

“I drew this for you”. She handed me a crumpled piece of notepaper. On it was a sketch of me, complete with wonky eyeglasses, captioned with my name at the bottom. She had replaced the ‘C’ with a second ‘K’. I also was wearing what looked like a scarf despite it being the middle of summer. 

“Thank you,” I replied as I quickly stuffed it into my pockets. To this day, this was the closest I’ve come to crying in front of a patient. 

I still wonder if Haniya was able to sense something was wrong as we sat together that day. I had been careful to not disclose anything regarding her illness but perhaps it was obvious something was weighing on my heart. 

When her parents returned to her room, accompanied by Charlotte, I could tell that Mariam had been crying. Rahim had a stoic expression on his face, yet his rigid demeanour radiated a sense of pain that eclipsed all else in the room. Our eyes met, they could tell that I knew. All I could muster up was a knowing nod as I departed.

Later that afternoon I ran into Rahim in the corridor. He had been pacing up and down the narrow hallway between patient rooms. I could tell he wanted to talk. The shame from earlier that day began to bubble up again - What kind of doctor would I be if I acted friendly before things went wrong, and avoidant afterwards?

I guided him back to Haniya’s room where she lay asleep in the dimly-lit room. Mariam sat by her side on an uncomfortable looking stool. I felt this wasn’t the place for a medical student, to be discussing terminal illness in private with a family, but their eyes told me they wanted me here. I remember thinking how remarkably composed they appeared considering the news they had received. 

“Haniya doesn’t know.” Rahim spoke in a slow, controlled manner. “We won’t tell her yet.”

An endless stream of questions spiralled through my head. What does death even mean to a child? How do you even explain it to them? 

As our conversation continued, his facade of composure devolved into agitation and despair. He asked questions regarding her treatment plan, her medications, her hospital stay.

“I’ll have to check with the doctors.” I found myself repeating this phrase again and again, each time feeling more frustrated with my ignorance and lack of control. 

For the next hour, I witnessed the desperation and delusion that a parent’s love takes on in times of darkness. Rahim showed me videos of an Indian guru who claims to have healed many children with SSPE. Despite my usual scientific eye, all I could tell him was “I’ll look into it a bit further”, aware of how desperately Rahim needed to sustain his hope. 

I felt painfully incompetent as I left the room, yet my conscience had calmed. They thanked me for my time, it was now well past going home time. I could never truly understand the hurt of Haniya’s parents, their anguish, their desperation. But I had faced my shame and offered my presence and time, something I now know to be immensely undervalued in the hospital setting.

Just like many things in medicine, the last time I saw Haniya was not marked by anything special. I had arrived at the last day of my placement at the children’s hospital. As I approached the bed for the final time, I noticed that her expression had begun to change. The inflammation from her illness was starting to affect the front of her brain, causing behavioural and personality changes. She was no longer as sharp as she was when I met her, and her seizures would occur every few minutes. I held her small hands as I said a quick goodbye, knowing this would likely be the last time I would lay eyes on her.

Six months later, as I had just begun my Emergency placement, I was told by a fellow medical student that Haniya had passed away. She had eventually lost her ability to speak, move, and eventually slipped into a coma until she finally died.

For some reason I had maintained some false hope that the diagnosis was an error, or she would be an outlier and live into her adulthood. I remember the sense of numbness I felt at the time, a sense of disbelief despite what the science had told me. 

This is the painful reality about death. It is not some special event that announces itself. It is not sacred in its apperance or occurrence. It is almost always unpleasant and torturous for both the sufferer and onlookers. 

My story is not a unique one amongst doctors. In fact, every practising doctor will be able to recount their first confrontation with mortality. 

I still keep the picture that Haniya drew for me in my wallet to this day. With Haniya’s death I know I have lost a part of me, the part of me that would allow myself to become fully emotionally connected to a patient. In a way this is a protective instinct that all health professionals must learn to avoid emotional burnout, but it comes at the cost of a deep, human connection to those you care for. 

In the same way, her passing serves as a reminder of my humanity and the purpose for which I’ve entered this field. I hope the compassion that Haniya inspired in me will never fade completely, but rather, be exercised with temperance.
