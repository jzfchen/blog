## Background

Marcus Aurelius was a Roman emperor and Stoic philosopher who ruled the eternal city nearly 2000 years ago. Marcus was born into a wealthy and prominent family. In his teenage years, Marcus became a well-rounded man and had a love of boxing, wrestling, running and falconry, unsurprising occupations for a upper-class youth of the time. In a similar vein, he began to cultivate his interest in literature and philosophy, guided by teachers who were likely educated Greek scholar-slaves. He would have been educated in both Latin, but also Greek, was the language of the writers, artists, and philosophers who constituted the intellectual elite at the time. It is no surprise that Marcus composed his _Meditations_ in Ancient Greek, as he required a familiarity with the terminology that the Greek philosophers he had studied in the past.

In 138 AD, the reigning emperor, Hadrian, who was childless and nearing death, adopted Aurelius Antoninus as his successor, under the condition that he adopted Marcus. Historical sources claim that Marcus met the news that he was second-in-line to occupy the most powerful position in the world with sadness rather than joy. 

When he assumed his duties as Emperor in 161, Marcus had developed a keen interest in the Stoic philosophies, and has become known as the first example of the ‘Philosopher King’ that Plato described centuries prior, a ruler who, despite having near unlimited power and influence, chose to lead a virtuous life, constantly evaluating himself and those around him with an admonishing eye. 

The 12 books that comprise Marcus Aurelius’ _Meditations_  were never meant to be viewed by anyone else. They were his private notes to himself as he navigated the balance between overwhelming responsibility, power, and virtue. They were his daily reflections, methods of mentally equipping himself to face what came his way. 

In my opinion, his _Meditations_ are a reminder of the timelessness of humanity’s flaws and virtues. The idea that a great Roman Emperor at the height of his power 1,900 years ago, contemplated the difficulty of getting out of bed. Unlike Epictetus’ _Discourses_ or Seneca’s  _Letters_, _Meditations_ is revered for it’s authenticity, it was not composed with a didactic purpose, but rather gives the impression of a deeply contemplative mind seeking to navigate pivotal political and mundane experiences alike, through reflections on his Stoic learnings. Numerous influential individuals throughout history have credited Marcus’ musings as a practical guide to living a virtuous and fulfilling lives. Cognitive behavioural therapy, the most evidence-supported form of psychotherapy, is strongly influenced by ideals that Stoic ideals; many more people in the modern world have been influenced by Stoicism than have actively studied it. 

I will not write more about the history and philosophy of Stoicism in this post, however I will reflect on some of its practitioners and ethical doctrines throughout my exploration of this text. [This article](https://dailystoic.com/what-is-stoicism-a-definition-3-stoic-exercises-to-get-you-started/) is an excellent introduction to the Stoic philosophy for those who are interested or want further context.


## The purpose of this series

I have little background when it comes to the study of Stoicism. From an external perspective, I have a basic logical and historical understanding of Stoic principles, however I am yet to delve into it’s philosophy and practice. I am aware of its criticisms: it can often be used as a guise for lacking emotional connection or empathy, it encourages passivity in the face of oppression beyond the locus of control, it seeks to discourage experiencing negative emotional reactions without identifying the philosophical root of such emotions. Nietzsche, in his book _Beyond Good and Evil_, offered a famous critique of the stoic philosophy, calling practitioners “stageplayers and self-deluders” for claiming to derive their teachings from ‘Nature’, while actually seeking to impose their own ideals and morality upon it. 

My aim is to document my experiences reading through _Meditations_ and other influential Stoic texts. From my limited understanding of Stoic philosophy there certainly appears value in applying some of its principles to live a “better” life - focused around its virtues of wisdom, justice, courage, and temperance. 

The idea of subscribing in totality to a school of thought does not currently appeal to me - I don’t believe it is necessary to become a Stoic to learn from the Stoics. I will aim to approach my study with an both an intellectual and practical openness - I will contemplate upon the writings that provoke thought, and consider how they may or may not be applicable in my life. My goal is not to reach some sort of intellectual enlightenment but simply to broaden my exposure to a revered school of philosophy and perhaps learn some valuable lessons on the way. 

## Studying Meditations

My approach to studying this series is to read through each book first, simply marking down those passages that resonate with me more. Then I re-read the book with greater scrutiny, writing down unfiltered thoughts on the Marcus Aurelius’ context, interpretations of the text, and possible applications to my own life. I read the Gregory Hays translation, it is the one that has felt least archaic to me and easiest to understand through my modern lens.

To supplement this, I personally find it helpful to understand the philosophical, theological, and geopolitical landscape of Marcus’ time. Reading the teachings of Epictetus that the Emperor himself would have studied also gives me perspective on the learnings he derived from his own intellectual pursuit.

My goal is to read Meditations each day and write down my thoughts on one or two passages that struck a chord with me. At the end of each week I will collate these thoughts and publish them as a record of my reflections. These writings will be addressed to myself and of a personal nature, however if you do read any of them and have any thoughts I would be delighted to discuss with you.
