## Day 22 12/02/24

### Statement 4.35

>Everything transitory—the knower and the known. 

What does this mean? No matter if you are enlightened or an idiot - it all only exists in the one instance. Marcus remembers he is mortal - Memento Mori. We cannot take it for granted

## Day 23 13/02/24

### Statement 4.36

>Constant awareness that everything is born from change. The knowledge that there is nothing nature loves more than to alter what exists and make new things like it. All that exists is the seed of what will emerge from it. You think the only seeds are the ones that make plants or children? Go deeper. 

When you are worried about new things that are difficult - remember that literally everything in the world is born from change. Every person, every experience needed to be new to someone at some point. That is not to say all change is good. But to be afraid of change is not the answer. Be open.

## Day 24 14/02/24

### Statement 4.38

>Look into their minds, at what the wise do and what they don’t. 

Being wise is subjective. Look at what the wise do - in their actions there lies embers of experience and mistakes. But also look at what they don’t. To abstain is also a form of wisdom in itself. Another interpretation is that even the wise have imperfections - seek not to mimic everything a wise person does, but be judicious when deciding what to copy and what not to. 

## Day 25 15/02/24

### Statement 4.39
>Nothing that goes on in anyone else’s mind can harm you. Nor can the shifts and changes in the world around you. 
—Then where is harm to be found? 
In your capacity to see it. Stop doing that and everything will be fine. Let the part of you that makes that judgment keep quiet even if the body it’s attached to is stabbed or burnt, or stinking with pus, or consumed by cancer. Or to put it another way: It needs to realize that what happens to everyone —bad and good alike—is neither good nor bad. That what happens in every life—lived naturally or not—is neither natural nor unnatural. 

Nothing someone else can think can hurt you, nor anything that happens in the world. The only way you can be hurt is if you feel hurt. If you stop letting these things hurt you, you can’t be. Realise that what happens to people cannot be labelled as bad or good. There is no objetive truth, only how we choose to perceive things. Don’t be hurt by what other people think or say about you. 

## Day 26 16/02/24

### Statement 4.42

>There is nothing bad in undergoing change—or good in emerging from it. 

Don’t be afraid to embrace change. There is nothing inherently wrong about changing. In fact to remain stagnant is to be absolutely sure that where you are now is acceptable - this cannot be the truth. Thus to emerge from change is to tell your soul - I am happy being like this for the rest of my life. Do you want to keep getting better or do you want be remain stagnant? That is not to say all change is inherently good - it is up to you to pick and choose when you want to stop. 

## Day 27 17/02/24
### Statement 4.43
>Time is a river, a violent current of events, glimpsed once and already carried past us, and another follows and is gone. 

Don’t lose sight of the fact that we are tiny pebbles in the river of time, chaotic happenings toss us around our whole lives. Everything you experience has been experienced by someone before you. No matter how important you think your own problems are, it has happened before. No matter how important/influential a person was, they eventually die. Whatever they have built up, the empire, the legacy, the riches, it is all knocked down by the river eventually. In knowing that we must embrace the present, do not take yourself seriously, your goals, your ambition. Don’t lose sight of the importance of living in the now.

## Day 28 18/02/24
### Statement 4.47
>Suppose that a god announced that you were going to die tomorrow “or the day after.” Unless you were a complete coward you wouldn’t kick up a fuss about which day it was—what difference could it make? Now recognize that the difference between years from now and tomorrow is just as small. 

What if we knew when we were going to die? Does it really matter if it is a Tuesday or a Wednesday? Not really. The concept that we are going to die soon is what really matters. What Marcus is saying is that in a way this is already what has been conveyed to us. We know our mortality is certain. Whether or not we will die tomorrow or live a long life essentially is the same thing. We should still be living every moment with our mortality in mind, that all things have come before and will come after us, and all we can do is live our best lives.
