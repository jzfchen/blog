My name is Jackson. 

I've just finished my last medical school examination. As a result of boredom/existentialism I have decided to launch this blog to ruminate on things, as I tend to do. Since I have no audience, this is essentially a more structured journal.

Sometimes these thoughts are profound (or so I like to think). 

Most of the time they are not.

I'm planning to start writing about a few things I've learnt in my four years at medical school. Maybe throw in some nerdy shit in between.

I've set a few goals for myself regarding the maintenance of this blog. Not that I feel I need to be held accountable, but it would be nice to get into a habit and truly take ownership of this site.
## My Goals 

1. **Post something every week (for now)**
   
    When I begin as a junior doctor I'll probably slow down. But who knows, maybe I'll have lots of free time, or maybe even become a full-time writer (I won't)
2. **Less than two hours per post**
    
    Including editing, formatting, and publishing. Not a strict rule, but hopefully this will mean I focus more on creating what comes to mind, rather than perfecting a piece
3. **Enjoy it!**

    Yeah I know this is cheesy. I'm not going to be really sharing this to anyone. I may as well have fun and learn something on the way. If anything it will be interesting to look back on in the future - perhaps laugh about how naive I used to be

### In case you were wondering  
1. I won't be disclosing too many specifics about hospital work - especially not about patients and staff - for obvious reasons
2. I'm not actively trying to keep my identity hidden (à la Batman) but probably won't share personal details unless it's somehow important to the post. Maybe I can cultivate a cult following as a faceless enigma (à la pre-face reveal Dream)
3. If you are a lawyer representing one of the people I will inevitably slander, this blog is purely fictional. Any resemblance to reality is a coincidence.
