## Day 8 - 28/01/24

### Statement 3.5

> Never act under compulsion, out of selfishness, without forethought, with misgivings. Don’t gussy up your thoughts. No surplus words or unnecessary actions. Cheerfulness. Without requiring other people’s help. Or serenity supplied by others. 
To stand up straight—not straightened. 

We must act in a way that is determined, motivated by good intentions rather than compulsion. We must act with direction, not out of pettiness or resentment. Don’t play up your thoughts in a way that make them sound more attractive. The purpose is not for other people to respect what you want to do, or how you think, but to understand your way of living from how you behave. Don’t say or do more than is necessary, especially if it is for the sole purpose of impressing others. Be a cheerful person to be around, a calming presence. You shouldn’t have to rely on the judgements and motivations of others to walk the “straight” path, this comes from within.

### Statement 3.7

> Never regard something as doing you good if it makes you betray a trust, or lose your sense of shame, or makes you show hatred, suspicion, ill will, or hypocrisy, or a desire for things best done behind closed doors. 

What is truly good for us? If we betray a friend or coworker to garner the favour of others; if we steal, lie, act out of spite, criticise others without reason, can this be truly thought of as good? Yes you might think there are short term benefits. But to do this is to degrade your soul. You know deep down that you are doing yourself a moral injustice. As you are the only one you can control, to choose to act in this way is far worse than having it done to you. You are betraying the one thing you have control over, to live this life is to corrupt yourself. True fulfilment cannot be attained this way. Think of this the next time you act in hatred, hypocrisy, laziness, the next time you want to do something that you would be embarrassed to admit to your friends or family. Do not criticise, do not speculate. These are not virtuous actions.

## Day 9 - 29/01/24

### Statement 3.9

> Your ability to control your thoughts—treat it with respect. It’s all that protects your mind from false perceptions—false to your nature, and that of all rational beings. It’s what makes thoughtfulness possible, and affection for other people, and submission to the divine. 

Another overlap between Marcus’ Stoic philosophies and more Eastern Buddhist influences. At the end of the day we have no ability to control what the universe bestows upon us, the one thing we can influence is the lens through which we view our circumstances. As Viktor Frankl noted after his time in Auschwitz - once all is stripped away from a man, all that is left is the attitude we apply to our circumstances, in that lies the power of living. On a less grave scale, in my daily life, make sure I am mindful of my own emotional reactions to daily happenings: I have the ability to control feelings of anger, resentment, jealousy. This is not who you want to be. Through the practice of mindfulness I can acknowledge these initial emotional reactions as not representation of true reality, but simply a mental habit. By shaping your thoughts towards goodwill, compassion, understanding, you will be a better friend, lover, companion, and spread joy rather than hatred amongst the people you love. This is not an easy process but an achievable one - be keenly aware of your ability to control your thoughts.

### Statement 3.10

> Forget everything else. Keep hold of this alone and remember it: Each of us lives only now, this brief instant. The rest has been lived already, or is impossible to see. The span we live is small—small as the corner of the earth in which we live it. Small as even the greatest renown, passed from mouth to mouth by short-lived stick figures, ignorant alike of themselves and those long dead. 

A repeat of some of the thoughts in Book 2 but nonetheless thought provoking. In my current context this is a reminder not to think so big, enjoy life as it passes by me, this moment in time will never happen again. Mission and purpose is necessary, but do not sacrifice the present moment in search of the future - for that future is to come, and the present will never be again. You play such a small part of world history and future, do not forget that and live in the present. 
## Day 10 - 30/01/24

### Statement 3.12

>If you do the job in a principled way, with diligence, energy and patience, if you keep yourself free of distractions, and keep the spirit inside you undamaged, as if you might have to give it back at any moment— 
If you can embrace this without fear or expectation—can find fulfillment in what you’re doing now, as Nature intended, and in superhuman truthfulness (every word, every utterance)—then your life will be happy. 
No one can prevent that. 

Keep your goals in mind and approach them every day with discipline, free of temptations and distractions. If your intention is pure, then the soul is not degraded. If your purpose is correct you will reach fulfilment in a way that cannot be reached by simply wandering aimlessly, or having a goal but not pursuing it with principle and diligence. If you have a goal why not work honestly towards it? To not put in the effort it deserves is to tell yourself that your purpose is less important than you think. 

### Statement 3.13

>Doctors keep their scalpels and other instruments handy, for emergencies. Keep your philosophy ready too—ready to understand heaven and earth. In everything you do, even the smallest thing, remember the chain that links them. Nothing earthly succeeds by ignoring heaven, nothing heavenly by ignoring the earth. 

Don’t forget your guiding principles even when times get tough. If you are philosophical, embrace philosophy. If you are spiritual, embrace spirituality. The physical and metaphysical are functionally distinct domains; each can guide the pursuit of the other.


## Day 11 - 31/01/24

### Statement 4.1

>Our inward power, when it obeys nature, reacts to events by accommodating itself to what it faces—to what is possible. It needs no specific material. It pursues its own aims as circumstances allow; it turns obstacles into fuel. As a fire overwhelms what would have quenched a lamp. What’s thrown on top of the conflagration is absorbed, consumed by it—and makes it burn still higher. 

We can think of the power we have within ourselves as a fire. A fire is not something you can actively act upon, however it does react to the things that you feed it. We have the choice to decide how our fire reacts to the fuel. When we encounter obstacles will we allow it to burn and consume us fully? Or we will use the fuel productively? Those things that seem to oppose us most fiercely may be the things that help guide us to become virtuous.

In my life I have faced obstacles where in retrospect they have given me the incentives to improve in my life. The reality is that things will happen to me, to the people around me. That is not what is in our control, but instead how we react to those obstacles and adapt them into something that furthers our goals.

I hope to ask myself the question when I am in a dark place or something has happened to me - “Yes you are hurt, yes that happened. Now what?”. This is not making you heartless or unemotional, but instead asking you to question whether you will let this obstacle consume you, regret your decisions, curse the heavens, blame others, or if you will move forward, hold close to you your goals and purpose. How will you turn hardship into progress? Hate into love? That is the question. I don’t have an answer, but I hope to keep asking myself that.


### Statement 4.2

> No random actions, none not based on underlying principles. 

I see the validity in this, we should always have some purpose, no matter how superficial, to our actions. In some way I disagree, I believe just as the things that happen to us are random, we should embrace our human nature in doing random things. A key thing is to be aware of our randomness, if I am feeling the sensation of tiredness I shouldn’t force myself to do work if I know it won’t benefit me as much as just having free time. In a way this “allowed randomness” is also a purposeful action. That is how I’d like to approach this, rather than making sure everything I do has a positive effect on my goals. Sometimes avoiding negatives is just as fruitful. 

## Day 12 - 01/02/24

### Statement 4.3 (a)

> People try to get away from it all—to the country, to the beach, to the mountains. You always wish that you could too. Which is idiotic: you can get away from it anytime you like. 
By going within. 
Nowhere you can go is more peaceful—more free of interruptions— than your own soul. Especially if you have other things to rely on. An instant’s recollection and there it is: complete tranquillity. And by tranquillity I mean a kind of harmony. 

Inner peace is hard to manage but when achieved it can be very freeing. Unfortunately we live such busy lives that it can be hard to tap into this aspect of ourselves often. I practice this through daily meditation, but when you are outside in the world it can be easy to be mindful. Being more aware that you have this tool in your toolbox is the first step. Remember that Marcus ruled over an empire racked with disease, war, politics, and he also found peace from within. So there must be some truth in it. Remember to breathe, reset, and carry on.

### Statement 4.3 (b)

> What’s there to complain about? People’s misbehavior? But take into consideration:  that rational beings exist for one another; that doing what’s right sometimes requires patience; that no one does the wrong thing deliberately; and the number of people who have feuded and envied and hated and fought and died and been buried. . . . and keep your mouth shut. 

Where to start with this one? When you feel like complaining about how other people have treated you, talked to you, treated others, first think of these things. First of all remember we all belong to the same species, we are all capable of feeling the same grievances, suffering, and on the other side of the spectrum happiness, peace, and fulfilment. Noone does the wrong thing on purpose (usually), we all do things in a way that align with our inner self overall. You should focus on living a life by your virtues without passing that judgment on others, for you are brothers and sisters. Remember humanity has consisted of billions of feuds, rivalries, revenge plots, and has been filled with bitterness, envy, and hatred for millions of years - at the end of the day all these people have died. And I am confident that deep down on their deathbed they wished they had not cursed all the people they had, mistreated others, and spent valuable time channeling negative energy towards others.

Finally - keep your mouth shut. Do not go on preaching about what is virtuous to others or boast of your success, they will think you either arrogant or annoying, neither of which serve you. In times of struggle and strife, do not complain except to those who you trust. Sharing only negative energy does not enrich the lives of those around you. Look within for answers, then seek those who can help.

## Day 13 - 02/02/24

### Statement 4.5
> Death: something like birth, a natural mystery, elements that split and recombine. Not an embarrassing thing. Not an offense to reason, or our nature. 

Death is not something to be feared, it is just as part of our nature as life. Marcus is very in touch with his mortality throughout his Meditations. For me I don’t have much to say about death. I guess I do fear my death, but more in the way that life can be taken away from me before I have to chance to actualise it. So live the life we have now.

### Statement 4.7
>Choose not to be harmed—and you won’t feel harmed. Don’t feel harmed—and you haven’t been. 

Marcus Aurelius poses the act of being harmed as a decision. It’s our choice to not be harmed. If someone does something to hurt us, we may be physically hurt, set back financially or reputation-wise, but it is our choice to let this affect us as a person. If you don’t let it affect you, it hasn’t. This stoic philosophy places the control in our own hands when someone does something intentionally or inadvertently to hurt us. Don’t hate them, remember you and them are one of a kind (see Statement 2.1). Remember you don’t have to let it harm your soul.

## Day 14 - 03/02/24

### Statement 4.8
> It can ruin your life only if it ruins your character. Otherwise it cannot harm you—inside or out. 
 
A continuation of Statement 4.7. What we see as our lives is made out of our physical belongings, our relationships, our social status, and our character. Yes someone can harm the other three aspects. But if it don’t let it affect the person you are, the path you walk, you have not been harmed. Remember the other three facets form around your character, not the other way around. If we cannot control the harm that comes to these facets, we should remain in control of the seed, our character - involving our motivations, our values, virtues, and purpose. Keep this locked away and protected from external forces. 

### Statement 4.10
> That every event is the right one. Look closely and you’ll see. 
Not just the right one overall, but right. As if someone had weighed it out with scales. 
Keep looking closely like that, and embody it in your actions: goodness —what defines a good person. 
Keep to it in everything you do. 

When something happens, think of it is as the “right” one. Not the one that brings you the best outcome, but an event that the universe has decided. We can’t control most of the happenings of the world. So it would be a greater disservice to let go of ourselves. Embody goodness in what we do, and how we react to each event, and hold it dear to you, that is all that matters.
