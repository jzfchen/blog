## Day 1 - 21/01/24

Note: Book 1 is Marcus Aurelius thanking the people close to him in his life, detailing their positive character traits that he would have wanted to emulate. I will return to this book in the future but start with Book 2. 

### Statement 2.1 

>“When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: The people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous, and surly. They are like this because they can’t tell good from evil. But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own—not of the same blood or birth, but the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine. And so none of them can hurt me. No one can implicate me in ugliness. Nor can I feel angry at my relative, or hate him. We were born to work together like feet, hands, and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower. To obstruct each other is unnatural. To feel anger at someone, to turn your back on him: these are obstructions. “

I don’t think Marcus was being arrogant here or assuming the worst of the people around him. It was true that being at the absolute pinnacle of the Roman Empire he had witnessed the worst of human nature; scheming, pettiness, jealousy, egomania. He begins his second book with a statement that does not deny the existence of these traits but rather acknowledges them. More importantly, he does not attempt to distance himself from these moral wrongdoings by separating himself from the people he refers to, realising we are all, in the end, human. Both possessing these unvirtuous traits and denouncing them are part of the human experience. To feel anger or hatred at these people is an “obstruction” in the same way that meddling, being ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous, and surly are “obstructions”. 

>“When a man assents, then, to what is false, know that he had no wish to assent to the false: 'for no soul is robbed of the truth with its own consent,' as Plato says, but the false seemed to him true.” – Epictetus

Epictetus states that noone does wrong willingly, they just act how they think is right. Maybe I am doing wrong every day, how am I to know? I am not always going to be the best version of myself, to judge and condemn others invites that same judgement and condemnation upon myself when I inevitably display these characteristics. Not only that, it invites paranoia and self-consciousness that other people are judging me, as criticism of others is inevitably a projection of your fear that others will judge you that way.

“We were born to work together like feet, hands, and eyes”. There is great truth in this statement. We are all brothers and sisters, we share the same genetic makeup, biological function, cognition, cultures. What right do I have to judge another, that through their lived experience has come to display these traits? My subjective reality is distinct from theirs, but the objective truth is that we are one and the same. 

I will inevitably deal with difficult people in my life. I will also inevitably become a difficult person to someone else at some point in my life. It’s not my duty to determine the circumstances and struggles that may or may not have led to someone acting in this way. It is also not my duty to judge them for it.

Acknowledge what you believe is unvirtuous but do not judge anyone but yourself. This is easier said than done, our minds are predisposed to attach labels, display arrogance, think we are better. Detach criticism from acknowledgement, just like mindfulness encourages you to detach emotional attachment from thoughts and perceptions.


### Statement 2.4

>Remember how long you’ve been putting this off, how many extensions the gods gave you, and you didn’t use them. At some point you have to recognize what world it is that you belong to; what power rules it and from what source you spring; that there is a limit to the time assigned you, and if you don’t use it to free yourself it will be gone and will never return. 

This theme of transience and contemplation of mortality is interwoven throughout Marcus’ _Meditations_. He is talking less about procrastination (as we of the modern world may see it), but rather the fact that he realises his life is coming to a close. He sees Time as a gift from the Gods, and thus to not use it would be an act of sacrilege. 

Applying this statement to my life is simple too. From a shallow perspective - time is linear, once it is gone it is gone. That time you spent lazing off instead of being productive is gone. Living is a blessing bestowed upon us by the universe, we live by its rules. Do the things you have been putting off, pursue the goals, foster the relationships. 

From a deeper perspective, it also makes me contemplate my mortality. I take my time on this Earth for granted. I am operating under the assumption that I will make it into old age, I will be able to benefit from these blessed circumstances and pursue my goals. For Marcus Aurelius and the citizens of Rome, they were faced with the horrifying reality of death almost daily, making it clear why he so frequently contemplated his own death. To be frank, there is no reason I should be so certain of living a long life either; many like myself have met an untimely demise. As such, noone should ever see time as unlimited - it is a message to me to do the things that matter to me when the opportunity arises. 

## Day 2 - 22/01/24

### Statement 2.5

> Concentrate every minute like a Roman—like a man—on doing what’s in front of you with precise and genuine seriousness, tenderly, willingly, with justice. And on freeing yourself from all other distractions. Yes, you can—if you do everything as if it were the last thing you were doing in your life, and stop being aimless, stop letting your emotions override what your mind tells you, stop being hypocritical, self-centered, irritable. You see how few things you have to do to live a satisfying and reverent life? If you can manage this, that’s all even the gods can ask of you. 

Again Marcus Aurelius contemplates his mortality from a place of true fear; he had seen many of his friends, enemies, and even his own children die. He was the original self-help guru. 

Principles of presence and mindfulness immediately come to mind. To treat every task and experience in front of you like it is the only one that matters. To not let random thoughts take over your control. This stoic philosophy is reminiscent of the Zen of Buddhism. To live life is to simply take part in the experience of the present in all its fullness - each of these experiences like a brush stroke on the larger canvas we call life. To ruminate on the thoughts of your future self is to be self-centered and irritable. Marcus states that “all” you have to do to like a satisfying life, one approved of by the gods, is to live honestly in the present and not be ruled by your emotions.

### Statement 2.6

> Yes, keep on degrading yourself, soul. But soon your chance at dignity will be gone. Everyone gets one life. Yours is almost used up, and instead of treating yourself with respect, you have entrusted your own happiness to the souls of others. 

Marcus may be addressing his own ego here, his internal voice. It is easy to self-criticise as much as it is to be self-aggrandising. He is also addressing the fact that not living by Stoic virtues is to degrade the soul - acting in a way that is not virtuous to please others is to degrade yourself.

To “entrust your own happiness to the souls of others” is to rely on external measures of success as we find ourselves doing so often - did we pass that exam? Did we get the job? Do they like me? Is value determined by others or from within? If we can truly only control our own actions then it makes no sense to rely on the validation of others. And in the same way if we act in a way that is greedy, self-centred, or unjust, in the pursuit of a goal that pleases others, or conforms to societal value, this is degrading our souls. Excessive self-deprecation has little value in our growth - whether it is intentional via feeling bad about ourselves, or unconscious - via acting against our virtues.

### Statement 2.7

> Do external things distract you? Then make time for yourself to learn something worthwhile; stop letting yourself be pulled in all directions. But make sure you guard against the other kind of confusion. People who labor all their lives but have no purpose to direct every thought and impulse toward are wasting their time—even when hard at work. 

Simply put, we must understand what our deeper purpose is in this world. If we are acting in a way that is random, with no end goal in sight, it is likely most of that effort will be for nothing, or may even set you back. You could have put in a life’s work of movement, just to find out that you have been oscillating back and forth about the same point. Choose a focus, do not let external thoughts and influences distract you, steady the course. Let your hard work contribute to your purpose.


## Day 3 23/01/24

### Statement 2.8

> Ignoring what goes on in other people’s souls—no one ever came to grief that way. But if you won’t keep track of what your own soul’s doing, how can you not be unhappy?

You will never be unhappy if you can live in a way that doesn’t worry about what other people are doing or thinking. We can only control ourselves. If they are happy, be proud of them. If they are miserable, understand them. But if they have ill will towards you, what good is it to acknowledge it?

If you can’t even have a clear awareness of self, how can you know makes you happy? Are you not then doomed to be unhappy? First, “Know yourself”, in the words of Socrates. That is the key. Understanding others will come naturally as a result. 

### Statement 2.10

> In comparing sins (the way people do) Theophrastus says that the ones committed out of desire are worse than the ones committed out of anger: which is good philosophy. The angry man seems to turn his back on reason out of a kind of pain and inner convulsion. But the man motivated by desire, who is mastered by pleasure, seems somehow more self-indulgent, less manly in his sins. Theophrastus is right, and philosophically sound, to say that the sin committed out of pleasure deserves a harsher rebuke than the one committed out of pain. The angry man is more like a victim of wrongdoing, provoked by pain to anger. The other man rushes into wrongdoing on his own, moved to action by desire. 

Self-explanatory. Wrongdoing committed because you are controlled by anger is a reaction to pain, inner conflict. Wrongdoing committed with intention is planned, motivated by illwill rather than just impulse.

## Day 4 24/01/24

### Statement 2.13

> Nothing is more pathetic than people who run around in circles, “delving into the things that lie beneath” and conducting investigations into the souls of the people around them, never realizing that all you have to do is to be attentive to the power inside you and worship it sincerely. To worship it is to keep it from being muddied with turmoil and becoming aimless and dissatisfied with nature—divine and human. What is divine deserves our respect because it is good; what is human deserves our affection because it is like us. And our pity too, sometimes, for its inability to tell good from bad—as terrible a blindness as the kind that can’t tell white from black. 

Don’t be the type who delves too deeply into the meaning of life and purpose, especially focusing too much on what other people’s internal journey should resemble. Your duty is to realise yourself first, live a virtuous life - abide by justice, wisdom, courage, temperance. That is what Marcus proposes is how we should live our lives, and that is what Nature wants of us. Living a virtuous life deserve our respect, but living a human life, that is, full of the human emotions of anger, greed, injustice, also deserves our affection because we are human and experience those emotions too. I should seek not to be blind of these emotions, but do not judge other people for exhibiting them. First, know thyself, focus on your own life. 

### Statement 2.14

> The present is the same for everyone; its loss is the same for everyone; and it should be clear that a brief instant is all that is lost. For you can’t lose either the past or the future; how could you lose what you don’t have? 

Every single feeling that I have had has been experienced by someone in the past or future. Our sense of individuality is an illusion. Everyone is living in the same present. If I choose to worry about the past or future, the implicit tradeoff is that I am losing the present. The present is all we have, and the past and future is not ours to possess. Focus on what you have to lose.

Why should I spend time thinking about how someone made me feel bad, or a poor interaction I had. I cannot be hurt if I do not give consent for it. Why should I worry about what is to come in the future if I cannot control it? To do so is to sacrifice the experience of the present; this will affect myself but also those around me - it is obvious when someone is not present. For myself, to be marred by worry, resentment, jealousy is the greatest injustice to myself, while affect my mental health and desire to do good things. 


## Day 5 25/01/24

### Statement 2.16

>The human soul degrades itself: (ii) When it turns its back on another person or sets out to do it harm, as the souls of the angry do. (iii) When it is overpowered by pleasure or pain. (iv) When it puts on a mask and does or says something artificial or false. (v). When it allows its action and impulse to be without a purpose, to be 
random and disconnected: even the smallest things ought to be directed toward a goal. But the goal of rational beings is to follow the rule and law of the most ancient of communities and states. 

Incredible statement. Marcus drops a five-for-one special; I have not included the first. Your soul degrading itself is to do yourself harm, to be unvirtuous. Firstly, do no harm - non-maleficence. As a doctor I hope this applies to my personal and professional life. Next comes the virtue of temperance - to be overpowered by either positive or negative emotions is to degrade your soul. Aristotle speaks of the ‘Golden Mean’, where true virtue is found between two extremes - courage between recklessness and inaction for example. 

When you put on a mask and act like someone that is not the true you, that is to degrade the self that you have developed after all this time. What’s the point? You are introducing tension between the false self and the real self - tension that will leak through and degrade your sense of self and become obvious to those you are trying to impress. Be genuine, and if you are not happy with the man you are, put in the true effort to change your identity. Finally, acting off impulse and without purpose is to be no different than our animal ancestors. If we live life with a goal in sight, we can be confident that we are utilising the limited time we have on the earth. These goals don’t have to be major life goals, it could be simply choosing to get out of bed that morning to be productive, meeting up with a friend to sustain a friendship, choosing a healthier meal to maintain your health. Together these statements essentially make up the principles of non-maleficence, temperance, authenticity, and purpose. 


## Day 6 26/01/24

### Statement 3.1
>Not just that every day more of our life is used up and less and less of it is left, but this too: if we live longer, can we be sure our mind will still be up to understanding the world—to the contemplation that aims at divine and human knowledge? If our mind starts to wander, we’ll still go on breathing, go on eating, imagining things, feeling urges and so on. But getting the most out of ourselves, calculating where our duty lies, analyzing what we hear and see, deciding whether it’s time to call it quits—all the things you need a healthy mind for . . . all those are gone. So we need to hurry. Not just because we move daily closer to death but also because our understanding—our grasp of the world—may be gone before we get there. 

I am young, healthy, ambitious, sound of mind. One thing is sure in this world, that we will get older. As someone with a keen interest in cognitive neuroscience I have seen the effects of dementia. How much time do we actually have? I frequently have thoughts such as “I’ll work on that when I reach X”, or “I don’t have to worry about that yet”. Why not now while I have a healthy mind and strong passion? Who knows what life will throw at me - I don’t want to wait around for that to happen. Take action now, no matter how small. 

### Statement 3.4

>Don’t waste the rest of your time here worrying about other people— unless it affects the common good. It will keep you from doing anything useful. You’ll be too preoccupied with what so-and-so is doing, and why, and what they’re saying, and what they’re thinking, and what they’re up to, and all the other things that throw you off and keep you from focusing on your own mind. 

Marcus Aurelius tends to repeat himself - this was a journal and not a book of teachings. This translation is remarkably frank, a reminder to simply focus on yourself; to be preoccupied with others is to allocate resources away from yourself. Don’t worry about what they are doing. If they are a high achiever, seek only what you can learn from them, do not be jealous. If they are performing poorly, why do I judge? Would I want to be judged in my moments of weakness? 

When it comes to the opinions of others - if it hasn’t been said, why do I assume people are thinking poorly of me? There is a good change that I am assuming that people view me with the same critical lens that I view myself, when they are probably too busy thinking of themselves. Beyond that, so what if they actually do think that way, or have acted negatively towards me? Why should that concern me? If I am already aware of myself, my strengths and weaknesses, why should I let someone with ill intentions affect me? And regarding the actions of others, if it is outside my control then let it happen. I shouldn’t care about how others are interacting with those I love or care for. It is up to them to regulate themselves - I have no right to control them, nor will it benefit me to do so. 

If it is to happen, then it is to happen - why interrupt what nature calls for? These thoughts only serve to throw me off what is important.

## Day 7 27/01/24

### Statement 3.4

> You need to get used to winnowing your thoughts, so that if someone says, “What are you thinking about?” you can respond at once (and truthfully) that you are thinking this or thinking that. And it would be obvious at once from your answer that your thoughts were straightforward and considerate ones—the thoughts of an unselfish person, one unconcerned with pleasure and with sensual indulgence generally, with squabbling, with slander and envy, or anything else you’d be ashamed to be caught thinking.  He does only what is his to do, and considers constantly what the world has in store for him—doing his best, and trusting that all is for the best. For we carry our fate with us—and it carries us. 

A continuation of the statement from yesterday. Always hold in your mind your own personal truth. What are you motivated by right now? Work towards being a person that can avoid being caught thinking unvirtuous thoughts. I don’t think its possible to be completely free of selfish desires, lust, envy, criticism. But let that not be my identity. It is possible to control myself from being consumed by my thoughts, by acknowledging their spontaneity and my detachment from my own random thoughts. Perhaps throughout the day, when I find myself thinking these negative things, I should think to myself - What if my thoughts were broadcast right now? Wouldn’t that be embarrassing? It is really up to me to control whether I let these thoughts control my day, and worse, my actions. 

In Frankl’s book ‘Man’s Search for Meaning’ two quotes stood out. 

> There is only one thing that I dread: not to be worthy of my sufferings.” - Fyodor Dostoevsky

> “Everything can be fallen away from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms- to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.” - Viktor Frankl

We have no control over what is to happen to us. When all is stripped away from us and we suffer, we still possess the liberty to choose our attitude towards the suffering. Will you assign a meaning to what the world has in store for you? Or will you lament, complain, curse God and those around you? Keep in mind your purpose and the power of love, for that is the one thing that can never be taken away from you.
