## Investment: A More Detailed Look

![png](/images/finance/stonks.png)

_Note: This is an adjunctive article to the ["Investment section"](https://jzfc.netlify.app/finance/finance2) of the main guide. While I would recommend you read this article first for a more comprehensive understanding of investment strategy, it is optional!_

Investing is probably the aspect of personal finance that scares people the most. The savings and budgeting part is pretty intuitive, finding the best bank interest rates, some people are even savvy with real estate. 

For some reason ‘investment’ has become somewhat of a financial boogeyman. If you ask someone why they haven’t invested the most common answers would be:

I don’t know enough/haven’t learn about stocks yet
I don’t earn enough to invest
I’m scared of losing money/my uncle lost it all/my mum told me to save everything

I’m going to address these three concerns directly now, and more comprehensively throughout the course of this article, which I have dedicated entirely to this incredibly important but surprisingly simple aspect of personal finance.

Investing isn’t (always) about picking stocks. In fact you can know absolutely nothing about stocks and be getting the same or better returns than the experts being paid 7 figures to pick them! (more on this later)
Investing is no different from putting money into a savings account. Yes brokerage fees can disproportionately eat into your deposits if you are investing small sums, but I will show you how to mitigate this factor
Investing does indeed open you up to more risk. But to reiterate a point from the last post - your youth is your superpower! 


### My own investing journey 

Investing is where the idea of **financial humility** that I mentioned in part one is most important. I want to share my own experience with the sharemarket and how that has shaped my investing philosophy today. 

**I began to trade literally the day I turned 18**. I had loved trading ever since I discovered the “ASX Sharemarket Game”, which gives you $50,000 in pretend cash to buy and sell companies as you see fit. My Mum had always been invested in the stock market and was my inspiration to begin trading. She taught me the fundamentals of value investing, and I soon became enamoured with the fancy terminology and complex-sounding terms: price-to-earnings, price-to-book, debt-to-equity, dividend payouts ratios. 

If you knew me during undergraduate university you would know I would spend most of my lectures with Commsec open on the Research tab, trawling through financial statements and annual reports to find the next undervalued stock I would invest in. I loved learning about these concepts, applying them in my decisions and seeing positive results!

**Investing became an emotional game to me.** Every morning at 10am I would race to open my portfolio; seeing green would make me happy, seeing red would make me depressed. It was honestly like gambling, on the best days I had seen daily gains in the thousands and on the worst I had lost more. I would bask in the dopamine hit from checking market movements constantly. In the morning I would read “market-sensitive announcements”, reports from companies that often lead to large (+- 5%) swings in price, and rush to put in buy and sell orders accordingly before trading opened in the morning. 

**I was an inexperienced investor, but not an uninformed one.** I made money on some trades and lost money on others. When accounting for brokerage fees, I had barely outperformed someone who stashed all their cash under the mattress. Except I had used time and effort to do it.

By the time I started medical school my passion for the market had faded a little and I was taking more of a backseat in my investments. I focused on medium-long term value investing but I was still invested in individual stocks. **In the first 3 months of COVID-19 I had $15,000 wiped from my portfolio value.** I still had to make decisions day-to-day based on my individual stock holdings. Between 35+ in-person hours at university and 20+ hours of online lectures I would have been overworked even without worrying about the stock market. 

### My two biggest lessons in trading


That year was when I made two big realisations that shaped my philosophy on trading today. 

#### Lesson 1: Stocks go up
Wall St media and brokers were claiming doomsday when COVID descended, they predicted a 5-year long recession, an end to the bull market. In less than a year the ASX200 was trading higher than it ever had. 

**Historical returns of ~9-11% p.a. over the past 10, 20, 30, even 100 years of the domestic and international indices should convince you there has been a strong trend of consistent economic growth.** 

But why should past performance predict the future? Paraphrasing the words of the world’s greatest investor, Warren Buffett, the economy will continue to grow over the long-term as long as the value of major asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) continues to rise, compared to cash. Growth in each of these classes and in the economy as a whole is dependent on gross productivity, and as long as the world continues to innovate and become more efficient, the global product will continue to increase and the world economy will continue to grow. If this assumption ceases to be true over the long term (20-30+ years), we will have **much bigger problems to worry about than the value of our stocks**. 

I want to mention that this is an oversimplification for the purpose of brevity. Some financial experts claim that we should be **expecting market returns of 3-5%** in the next 30 years rather than the traditionally quoted 8-10%. These estimates have been made based on the assumption that growth in stock market prices have outpaced global output, i.e. the market is overvalued (based on all time high Shiller P/E and Market Cap/GDP ratios). My opinion is that there is truth in this statement

I would encourage you to **do your own research**, but also keep in mind that there will always be people who either believe the market is overvalued or undervalued, and economic doomsayers have been around since the beginning. 

#### Lesson 2: Value investing works, but you probably won’t be good at it

I have no regrets in dabbling in individual stock trading. Learning about business valuation is fundamental to investment, in fact, up until 20 years ago it was definitely the most used and trusted strategy. Buffett himself made most of his fortune from identifying companies he thought to be undervalued, and sticking with them long term. 

The problem with this strategy for the “Mom-and-Pop” investor (e.g. me and my mother) is that 
1. We don’t have the market experience to value companies as accurately as Warren Buffett
2. We have no insider information
3. When Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway invests in a business, it provides immense capital backing, access to infrastructure and financial services, and management expertise. 

Berkshire investing in a company is like strapping a jet engine onto a boat. When you and I invest in an individual company, we are the little hitchhiking remora that you see on the undersides of sharks. Yes, we provide symbiotic value via share capital, yet we aren’t able to stop the shark from getting eaten by an orca or harpooned by a fisherman.

Perhaps the most important factor for me is **time**. I have no aspirations to be a career trader; while it interests me it certainly isn’t my life calling. Even if I was some investment prodigy, to hone and exercise my investment skill to the extent where I can consistently outperform the market would likely require considerable working hours, akin to a part- or full-time job.

The goalposts have shifted: I want an investment product that provides (historically) exceptional returns compared to competing options, simplicity, reduced volatility, and takes less than an hour a month to maintain. Seems impossible right?

## Introducing the index fund:

Warren Buffett is perhaps the greatest of the “active” managers. It is his ideas on value investing that inspired an entire generation of traders to learn the craft, including my mother and myself. 

Yet he has not wavered in his investment advice to everyone, from people of modest means to his billionaire colleagues: **Invest regularly in a low-cost index fund.**

An **index fund** is a type of investment fund that aims to replicate the performance of a specific market index, such as the S&P/ASX200. It achieves this by weighting the assets held by fund based on its market capitalisation; If a company accounts for 30% of all the money in the market, the index fund will hold 30% of its money in that company’s shares. This allows mitigation of risk due to the inbuilt diversification. 

Investing in an index fund over a long period is known as **passive management**. By definition, the goal is to simply be average in comparison to the movement of the market.

### Monkeys and a dartboard


![png](/images/finance/2.png)


In 1973 Burton Malkiel, economist and Princeton University professor claimed that **“A blindfolded monkey throwing darts at a newspaper’s financial pages could select a portfolio that would do just as well as one carefully selected by experts.”

Malkiel was wrong. The monkeys actually did a much better job than the experts. Their random stock allocation closely resembled the diversification offered by index funds. Passively holding the same portfolio for a year minimised brokerage fees and management costs. 

I think we could all be taught a lesson by the monkeys in financial humility when we are learning the art of value investing.

### What about hiring an expert to make trading decisions for me?

This strategy is known as **active management**. The most well known implementation of this strategy is by hedge funds, whose explicit goal is to outperform the market. The ultra elite entrust **billions** to these hedge fund managers - they are known as the best of the best in the financial world, with their high-speed trading models, Wall St insider information, and dedicated teams of analysts all working towards the ultimate goal of beating the passive strategy.

**Naturally the active management, funds getting paid billions and employing the superstar talent, should generate better returns than the passive strategy right?**

### A legendary bet

In 2007, Warren Buffett made a $500,000 wager that no-one could select five hedge funds, managed by the brightest and most accomplished money managers in the world, that would outperform the S&P 500 index over a 9 year period. 

Surely the five best hedge funds could, on average, be better than someone who simply invested passively, sat on their hands and did nothing?

Protégé Partners’, a ‘fund-of-funds’, took Buffett up on the bet, wagering that the average performance of his five selected funds would be better than the average of the market.


Here are the results after 9 years:

![png](/images/finance/return.png)

The passive strategy won by a landslide. 

The reason was simple. The investor’s worst nightmare returns again - management fees. 

Hedge fund managers are some of the best paid people in Wall St. The reason is because of their **2 and 20 compensation structure**: 2% of total investment and 20% of profit above a given rate (usually 8%). Let’s say a fund managers $10b and makes $1b (10%) in profit that year. The fees that year would be $200m (2% of total) + $40m (20% of the 200m above hurdle rate) = $240m. That means the investors are walking away with $760m, making its effective annual return 7.6%. 

Fund managers are amongst the most intelligent and most respected members of the financial world, and are compensated as such. Unfortunately that compensation comes directly out of the investor’s pockets, regardless of whether or not they turned a profit.

**But what if they could generate enough value with their management expertise to justify the high fees?**

You are right in proposing this rhetorical question, dear reader! Indeed if the market average return is 8% p.a. and a fund delivers 15% returns, even after a 3% fee they would still outperform the market (12% net). 

Unfortunately historical data has indicated that over a long period, it is **exceedingly rare** for an actively managed fund to outperform the index, after you account for fees. 

In his book ‘The Little Book of Common Sense Investing’, founder of The Vanguard Group Jack Bogle lays out the evidence. 

He found that 80% of hedge funds operating in 1970 had since gone out of business, likely due to poor performance. Of the remaining funds, only 14% of delivered returns more than 1% above the S&P500 index fund. 

So basically of all the hedge funds that existed since 1970, **only 3% could actually deliver clearly above-market returns**, once you accounted for the fees. 

The same trend exists with actively managed funds in Australia. SPIVA’s 2018 report found that over 15 years, more than 80% of actively managed funds underperformed the market index after fees. Of the 20% that met or exceed the market, the results were not sustainable, over the next 5 years, 75% of these funds underperformed the market. 

This demonstrates that those funds that outperformed the market over long periods likely had a **large element of luck**, rather than skill alone. 

So you can choose to trust the index fund, which requires lower fees, less time, less knowledge, and less effort, or have faith that you will be in the 3% that have so far outperformed the market.

## Investments and Risk

![png](/images/finance/chad.png)

Any financial product that offers higher rates of return than a savings account must come with risk. An index fund is considered one of lowest risk stock trading strategies for the simple reason that it is well-diversified. By investing in the whole economy, large deviations in the success of a single company or sector will have a smaller impact on your overall portfolio.

What you must understand about volatility is that it has no significant impact on the long-term investor. When you buy and hold an index fund long term you are making a bet against the world economy. 

The bet is that, while it will certainly undergo highs and lows, it will ultimately trend upwards. For you to lose the bet would mean some long-term (20+ years) disruption to global production, drastic decline in productivity and innovation (extremely unlikely in our age of entrepreneurship), or some global extinction event. In all of these cases we will have much bigger problems than the number of zeros in our account.

### Youth as your superpower: Be aggressive!

Starting investing young is therefore your biggest asset. If your goal is indeed to save for retirement, short-term fluctuations in your portfolio shouldn’t faze you. Volatility is naturally countered by time. If you are not in a rush to take your money out, you will eventually see your 7-8% p.a. compounded returns. 

While I should ideally separate my emotions from trading, I’ve grown to love economic downturns as an investor - it’s like a fire sale for ETFs that I **know** will almost always rebound. 

### Modern Portfolio Theory and Asset Allocation

![png](/images/finance/modern.png)

When you are young you should in fact be utilising **the most aggressive asset allocation available**. No, I don’t mean Dogecoin or NFTs, and it has nothing to do with being young and learning from experience either. 

In Modern Portfolio Theory, there exists the concept of the Efficient Frontier (see image). To the top right of this line is a portfolio with the highest risk/highest return strategy. On the bottom left is the low risk/low return strategy. Anywhere on the line is considered an “efficient” portfolio, it simply depends on your level of risk tolerance.

**In order of riskiness, shares are considered the most risky, followed by bonds, and finally cash (essentially 0 risk).** 

This is also the order of their expected return, riskier investments generally provide higher returns. In terms of asset allocation, the top right would represent a shares/bond/cash distribution of 100/0/0, the middle may be something like 60/30/10, and the bottom left (losers) is 0/0/100. 

As I have explained - we have the power of **time** on our side. Therefore young people should opt for a **high growth, aggressive strategy** - placing most of our money into higher risk, higher return investments. 

A commonly used rule is the “**120 - age rule**”: Subtract your age from 120 - that is the suggested percentage you should be holding in stocks and other high risk investments.

I am 24, so I should be holding 96% of my portfolio in stocks. As I reach 60, there may be more unforeseen personal and economic events meaning I cannot tolerate this higher risk, I will instead hold only 60% of my portfolio in higher risk investments. 

For more conservative people, they often use the **”100 - age“** rule instead. 

### How does this apply to ETF Internationa:Domestic allocation?

Within your ETF holdings, international index-tracking ETFs tend to be higher return and higher risk (an aggressive strategy), while Australian index-tracking ETFs are lower risk, lower return. So the top right might represents a 100% International 0% Domestic allocation, and vice versa for the bottom left. There is no right or wrong portfolio; I prefer somewhere on the riskier side like 70:30. 

Note that the Australian market will not necessarily underperform international indices. You should be adjusting your split depending on your risk appetite and long-term historical returns.

## A final word
Hopefully you feel relatively comfortable about main differences and benefits and disadvantages of each of the financial products I have discussed: individual stock investing, passively managed portfolios (index funds), and actively managed portfolios (managed funds). 

If you got all the way through this article, I think you will also take pleasure in reading ["Warren Buffett’s ‘victory’ letter"](https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2016ltr.pdf) after he won his legendary bet; it sums up most of what we have talked about here and more.

I’ll leave the choice to you.
