# Conscious Spending

Many beginners guides will spend most of their time discussing budgeting, and place it right at the beginning. They’ll rave on about how to save on your electricity bill, how to make that loaf of bread last longer, and how to go longer without doing laundry.

**Budgeting alone is doomed to fail**

It’s my opinion that this penny-pinching approach to personal finance misses the big picture and turns accumulating wealth into a negative experience rather than an inherently positive one. 

Not only that, neglecting to understand and implement **financially-sound investments** will have an even bigger impact on your life; saving $25 a year on your shampoo bill isn’t going to make you rich one day.

Depleting yourself of the things that make you happy or save you time is the surest way to ensure you quickly abandon your financial plans and revert to poor financial habits.

I asked you to reflect on your purpose for acquiring money in Part 1. Bring your purposes to mind again. If the act of becoming “rich” requires you to sacrifice the ideals that are important to you for decades, is it really the path for you?

Even if you are insanely disciplined and manage to survive the most stingy lifestyle: what good is retiring at 55 if you spend the prime of your life eating beans and toast, neglecting your friendships, not living through the experiences you want?

## My view on conscious budgeting

**Budgeting is absolutely necessary for a healthy financial life.**

You might think this is contradictory to what I just discussed - let me explain. 

Conscious budgeting, a concept I’ve adapted from Ramit Sethi’s books, is not meticulously maintaining an Excel spreadsheet, tracking every single cent you spend, and hating yourself for buying that dress.

Conscious budgeting requires first having a clear awareness of the dollar value of four main categories:

1. **Your take-home pay**. Do not budget off your gross income (with some exceptions) as this may lead to overspending.
2. **Your “needs”** - how much you spend on things you cannot survive without. These include housing, utilities, bills, transport, childcare etc. 
3. **Your savings and investment goals**
4. **Your “wants”** - things you spend on to live a happy life but technically can survive without.

### Saving without sacrificing: the sustainable approach to finance

My philosophy is simple: **pay yourself first, and the rest can be spent guilt-free**. 

By ‘paying yourself’, I mean paying your **future self**: allocating money to your necessary expenses, investments, savings, and super. 

All the money left behind can be lumped together to be spent on my ‘wants’, items or activities that make your life worth living. 

The key here is **sustainability** - once you realise that you can work towards your retirement while still having a good quality of life, personal finance becomes less of a chore and something you look forward to!

### What “wants” matter to you?

**I want you to complete the following exercise before reading on:**

1. Get a pen and paper (best)
2. Divide the page into three columns (see image below)
3. In the left column, write, in order from most important to least, the broad categories that you prioritise to live a quality life **day-to-day, not in the future**. Leave yourself space between each category, at least 3-4 lines. Don’t include large yearly goals such as travel
4. In the middle column, next to the associated category write the associated activities or expenses. If you see something as non-negotiable like a gym membership, don’t list it.
5. In the right column, write what you would like to spend on these expenses per month. e.g. “Netflix - $15”, “Eating out - $300”. For longer term goals divide the cost to obtain a monthly cost - e.g. if you travel yearly, divide the cost of the trip by 12. Referring to your banking app can help you get a realistic idea. 
6. Add up the right-most column.

Look over your list. Think about which items are necessary to you. Which expenses could you cut down, and which ones could you potentially eliminate?

Calculate what percentage this total is of your take home pay. Chances are it lies somewhere between 10-30%. Remember this is just an estimate, try to include all the things that really matter for you. 

Keep this number in mind for later. 

**Here’s an example:**

## Getting started with Conscious Spending

Let’s work on the “paying ourselves” part before we focus too much on the spending (you’re probably already pretty good at that). 

This is the lame part, but also where you will make the biggest difference for your future. 

Monthly expenditure can be broken into 4 main categories: **Fixed Costs, Savings, Investments, and Guilt-free Spending Money**

Here is a suggested breakdown of how much of your take home pay you should be spending on each category:

| Category | Proportion of income |
|---|---|
|  Fixed Costs | 50-60% |
|  Savings | 5-10% |
|  Investment | 10-15%|
|  Guilt-free spending | 20-30% |

In the next sections we will begin to refine this distribution until it is personalised for you. If you live at home, your fixed costs will naturally be much less, freeing up more money for savings and investments. If you have a mortgage, your fixed costs might be much more. 

The argument I’d like to get across is that you should let the first and last categories have the biggest impact on your conscious budget. 

This may sound counterintuitive, but let the “wants” that you wrote down in the last section should be a **genuine priority** for you when developing this plan. Some people might be able to squeeze their guilt-free spending down to 10% and still be happy. 

**To reiterate, don’t force yourself to invest and save more if it means encroaching upon the things that make you happy!** If you feel like you are spending too much for your income, we will discuss later how you can approach cutting down your discretionary costs in a structured way. 

## Fixed Costs

With rising costs and inflation, it starts to feel like more and more of our paycheck doesn’t actually belong to us. 

Before we think about how we’re going to invest, save, and spend, we need to know how much money we actually have to work with after our necessary costs.

The best way is to simply fill out a table like the one below. Use the few months in your bank statement to guide you, and add additional categories as necessary. 

| Item | Monthly Cost |
|---|---|
|  Rent/Mortgage | - |
| Groceries | - | 
|  Utilities (Water, Electric) | - |
|  Phone/Internet Bill | - |
|  Transport (Fuel, Public, Parking) | -  |
| Super contributions | - | 
| Work equipment/clothes | - | 
| Medical bills/Insurance | - |
| Home maintenance | - | 

Total up the costs: these are your **Fixed Costs**.

There will always be **unexpected expenses**, whether it be car repair fees, parking fines, or flowers for your partner because you said something dumb. I suggest you take your current Fixed Costs and add 10-15% to account for this. Any unused money can go to savings at the end of the month.

Calculate what proportion of your monthly income this final amount is. Subtract that percentage from 100% to determine how much you have left to invest/save/spend. 

### The practical side: separating fixed cost and discretionary balances

I actually use a **separate bank account** and card for fixed costs and for other spending. My fixed costs and bills are paid out of my CBA transaction account, and my guilt-free spending money is kept on my ubank transaction account. 

From an accounting perspective I have a clear way to distinguish how much I’ve spent that month on my  “needs” and my “wants”.

From a convenience perspective, I can look at my ubank account and know how much more “guilt-free” money I have left to spend that month. 

For example, let’s say you get paid on the 1st of the month but rent is due on the 15th. Without separating the balances, you don’t have an easy way to tell how much can be spent freely, and how much is reserved for rent. 

In the **Automation** section I will detail more clearly all the transfers I make and how I use my accounts. 

## Savings

### The Emergency Fund

This is a crucial concept to understand but less important for younger people who can just borrow money from mum and dad in an emergency.

It is designed for people, especially those with families, who may face circumstances in which they **lose their income for an extended period**, whether due to redundancy, illness, disability, or natural disaster. 

To get started, set a savings goal to accumulate **3-6 months of expenses** (including fixed costs and discretionary spending). Once you have reached this goal, ensure that this fund is always maintained, ready for when unforeseen circumstances occur. I have a separate subdivision of my savings account for my emergency fund, to ensure I don’t accidentally spend out of it.

I would recommend everyone to **maintain a small emergency fund to build good financial habits**, even if it is one or two weeks of expenses. 

### Two common behaviours

Most people can identify with one of the two following behaviours when it comes to savings.

**Sporadic Steven**

Sporadic Steven keeps most of his monthly paycheck in his transaction account. He doesn’t want to have to worry about how much is in his account when he pays for dinner, that would be embarrassing! Every couple of months he notices his transaction account balance has grown quite high, and he moves a large sum to his savings.

**Re-dip Reagan**

Re-dip Reagan religiously transfers all the money to his savings account as soon as it exceeds $200. He knows the power of compound interest, and wants to make sure he is maximising the proportion of his cash that is being compounded. Whenever his transaction account balance drops too low, he ‘re-dips’ into his savings account and tops it back up to $200. His card has declined a couple times on dates, and he has to check his bank account before he buys groceries sometimes, but at least he knows he’s getting the most out of his savings!

**Steven is missing out on valuable compounding gains while Reagan suffers from a convenience issue.**

My recommendation is thus to **calculate how much you want to save each month**. When your paycheck materialises in your transaction account, transfer that sum to your savings. This should leave enough money in the account for your everyday expenses. 

### Goal-based savings: my approach to conscious savings

One approach to savings that I use involves assigning a purpose for every single dollar in your savings account. You may also know it as the ‘Envelope System’.

Instead of contributing a fixed 5-10% of your income mindlessly each month, this method asks you to write down every goal you are saving for and the timeframe you need the money by. Then, divide the cost by the number of months to determine the monthly costs.

**Try it now, fill out a table like this! Here’s an example:** 

| Goal| Total needed| No. of months | Monthly cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| New bike | 2400  | 12 | 200 | 
| Holiday | 3000 | 12 | 250|
| Coldplay concert | 150 | 2 | 75 |
| Christmas gifts | 480 | 6 | 80 | 

This person would need to be currently saving $605/month to meet these goals without eating into their emergency fund or investments. Saving becomes easier when you know 6 or 12 months down the line this will materialise into something you’ve been working towards. 

This method may be tedious, but gives you more motivation to save money and allows you to estimate whether your saving goals are realistic. I only implement this for long term goals that cost over $1000 like new instruments or holidays, and use it generally to calculate how much I should be saving.  

If you do this calculation and it makes up a large portion of your income, you may need to consider reducing the total cost of the goal, or stretching it over a longer period. 

Whatever way you end up approaching savings, try to allocate at least 5-10% a month, and make sure to maintain your emergency fund. 

## Investment

In the last section you should have decided on the ETFs that you want to invest in monthly. Now we will decide what proportion of your income to invest.

There isn’t a hard and fast rule, aim for 10-15% but tweak this based on your spending and savings goals. 

The aim is to get into the **habit of investing every single month** regardless of the ETF price. Skipping one or two months is fine if you have some unforeseen expenses, but try to plan ahead for those. If you don’t make an intentional habit out of investing, you are missing out on the maximal benefit of compounding returns, as we discussed in Part 2. 

In the next section I will discuss how to automate your investments so you don’t even need to think about them. 

## Guilt-free Spending

Whatever has been left behind after your fixed costs, investments, and savings, is yours to spend as you see fit. 

The important thing about this discretionary allowance is that **once it’s gone, it’s gone**. There’s no transferring yourself more money from your savings or skipping a month of investing. You still need to exercise an element of discipline.
### Cut unnecessary costs ruthlessly

The idea of investing in your future retirement as well as living a happy life now is idealistic, but is it realistic?

The reality is that if you are planning to save and invest more than you were previously, this assumes **your guilt-free spending money will have to decrease.** 

There is a way to do this that doesn’t affect your quality of life as much as you might think. 

Consider the list of your wants that you made earlier, what you considered necessary, adjustable, and skippable all together. You are in charge of this decision - it is up to you to decide which things you are willing to give up or reduce. 

Using the example list I made: I might not be willing to give up on my daily coffees, how much I spend eating out with friends. However I might realise I don’t really need my Netflix subscription, or that I don’t really care about buying designer clothing that much. 

Go down the list in reverse order of your priorities, and start to cull the things that don’t actually matter to you as much. Remember the goal is to spend guilt-free on the things you love so that you can sustainably save and invest for your future, without compromising your happiness today.

If you’ve reached a point where everything left is what you need to stay happy, maybe **you aren’t the stage in your career where you should be investing or saving large significant monthly**. 

While it’s good to develop these habits, the reality is that there are indeed occupations **where it is extraordinarily difficult to survive, invest, save, and stay happy**, and that it is a very privileged position to be able to contribute towards your future.

## Conclusion

If you have now calculated your fixed costs and discretionary spending you are already ahead of most people when it comes to personal finance.

If you've made a plan to invest and save a certain amount monthly you are already a whiz. 

I want you to remember that the spending plan you have made is a guide, after the first month you will inevitably tweak things to make it all work. Keep in mind the goal is sustainability - paying yourself while enjoying the things you love. If you have been too restrictive on your guilt-free spending, move things around so you have $100 more that month. Or if its been too easy, consider investing or saving a bit more.

Good luck!

## Actionable Steps: Part 3

1. Use the table provided and your last bank statement to write down all of your fixed costs ('needs')
2. Add your fixed costs and determine what percentage of your net monthly income it takes up
3. Write down your expenses that are not necessary to survive - your 'wants'
4. Be honest with yourself - mark down which things you are not willing to give up, things you would consider reducing, and things you are able to cut out completely
5. Calculate the percentage of income your 'wants' contribute. 
6. Subtract from 100% your fixed costs and your guilt-free spending money. Divide it amongst investment and savings, favouring investments slightly. 
7. Calculate how much in dollar value you are allocating towards each category. Consider your individual savings goals (holiday, new phone etc.) and make sure you are saving enough for them.
8. Tweak your initial estimates every month until the allocation feels right.
