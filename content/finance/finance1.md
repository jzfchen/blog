### Preface

**Warning: This guide is very long.** 

I aimed to keep it under 5000 words but I have clearly failed. I understand no one wants to read 17,000 words in one sitting, I would recommend you break it down over a number of days, taking time to implement the suggested steps in between. 

The word **"Minimalist"** in the title is not poking fun at the length or complexity of the guide per se. It is instead referring to the **'minimalistic' relationship** you will have with finance once you have set everything up. It will be like a well-oiled machine that generates retirement savings for you, only requiring a couple hours maintenance each week. 

**If you do get through any of this series, thank you dearly for reading it.**

This guide serves as a guide first and foremost to myself, summarising all I have learnt in my own journey. If you take away a single piece of theory, philosophy, or practical advice from it I would be very satisfied. 

There are many theoretical concepts discussed in this guide, I consider them to be the **absolute basics** required to understand your financial decisions. I would strongly recommend you refer to the resource list if you are interested. Honestly, you are doing your future self a massive service by learning these things early - you will need these concepts at some point in your life and I don't think you will regret learning them now.

_This is a guide and not my formal advice to you. I highly encourage you to learn and verify concepts yourself, and consider seeking other advice before making changes to your banking, investments, or superannuation which may have large impacts on your financial position._ 

## Introduction

_This first post serves as an introduction to the fundamental philosophy that will help guide and facilitate an understanding of the decisions made in the plan._

The easiest way to be wealthy is to be born into a rich family. The second best way is to subscribe to my exclusive 12-step programme - **The Insider’s Club** - including guided meditation sessions, one-on-one private coaching, and daily fit checks. Now available for the low price of $50 a week.   

Despite the bold claims of the many get-rich-quick gurus who have sprung up over the last decade, paying a random guy on the internet an obscene amount for generic advice is not the best strategy to accumulate wealth. 

## A simple guide in a complicated world

Approaching the world of money can be confronting. Entering our working life, we are bombarded with finance-sounding words: shares, bonds, real estate, credit scores, liabilities, assets, annuities, dividends, derivatives, equity, mutual funds, and taxes! 

Financial literacy from an early age should be the norm, rather than the exception. However, I feel that the burden has fallen upon young people to teach themselves how to get good with money, navigating the treacherous monetary landscape of rising housing prices, inflation, and stagnant wage growth. 

I’ve read enough rubbish budgeting guides and frugal lifehacks that assume that somehow cutting out a $4 coffee every morning is going to make you a millionaire. Surprisingly, being good with your money is actually simpler and much less painful than giving up your daily caffeine hit. I’ve envisioned this post as a minimalist guide to managing finances easily and effectively, without giving up what’s important to you. 

## This bozo is not qualified enough to write this! 

I am, of course, not a financial expert, maybe not even a financial novice. Fortunately, as a beneficiary of the Information era, I’ve been able to learn from the best - investing titans like Benjamin Graham, Warren Buffett, Charlie Munger, and Tai Lopez.

This guide has taken some heavy inspiration from some great books which I would highly recommend you read for the complete theory and supporting evidence behind the practices I would recommend. If you’re like me, you can’t truly buy into some crappy blog post advice unless you’ve seen the evidence yourself. 

If anything, I’d hope that each of the methods and concepts I discuss in this article provides you the impulse to personally verify the evidence and calculations; I would not personally take the investment advice of a 24 year old with $88,000 in HECS debt as gospel. Hopefully, if you have run the same maths as me, you will find that implementing this system now can lead to hundreds of thousands of bonus retirement savings in the future. I’ve included a resource list at the end of the last post.

## The basic philosophy of personal finance

### Youth is your superpower!

You already know the value of compound interest, but we often underestimate its power. Take two characters, Arthur Aardvark and Bugs Bunny. Arthur is smart and starts investing at 25. Bugs is dumb (in comparison) and starts investing at 35. Both invest $500 a month, except Arthur only actively invests for 10 years and lets the money compound until he’s 65. Bugs puts in $500 every month for 30 years, until he is 65. 

Who do you think will end up with more money at retirement?

|   | Arthur Aardvark | Bugs Bunny |
|---|---|---|
| Starts when they are  |25 years old  | 35 years old |
|  Each person invests $500 a month for |10 years  |30 years |
| Account balance at 65 (8% p.a return)  |**$926,600**  | **$750,148**  |

 
Arthur has saved an **extra $176,000 for retirement**, despite investing for one-third the time, having deposited $120,000 less, simply due to starting ten years early. 

I know you know this already but I still find myself surprised at how powerful time can be when I calculate examples like these. 

**Your decision to start early will be your superpower!**
 
### Getting started is more important than being an expert

It’s easy to be overwhelmed by the assumption we have to manage money perfectly. The reality is that even by taking some small steps you are already far ahead of most of your peers. Personal finance is a continual game of trial and error,, figuring out what you can and can’t cut, understanding the changing value of investments, rebalancing your portfolio, refinancing your loans. The best way to learn is to get stuck in and start implementing things a little at a time, it will always be better than doing nothing.

### Smart finance is not penny-pinching

![png](/images/finance/saving.png)

Last year I stumbled upon Ramit Sethi, a finance guru-type who authored the bestseller ‘I Will Teach You to Be Rich” and now stars in his own Netflix series ‘How to Get Rich’. Despite my usual disdain for these types, I found myself resonating with his philosophy:

> Spend extravagantly on the things you love, and cut costs mercilessly on the things you don’t.  

Being good with saving is not being stingy with everything, skipping out on eating out with friends, buying groceries only on special, never traveling overseas. If you cheap out on everything, two things will happen. 

1. You will be seen as a miser and people will talk shit about you
2. You will be unhappy and less likely to adhere to sustainable financial habits

If you love music, buy that $3000 guitar! If you want to travel, spend $10,000 on your dream Iceland trip! You can do all of this guilt-free. Obviously we don’t have unlimited money, so something has to give - you have to prioritise what you spend on. 

If you don’t care about having the latest iPhone, don’t buy a new one every two years. If you don’t care about name brand fashion, stick to essentials. Know what matters to you and what doesn’t, and treat them accordingly. 

By living a life where you know you are saving the money you need to, while also being able to spend guilt-free on what you love, you will realise that personal finance doesn’t have to be miserable, or a chore, or even take more than 2 hours a month. In the **Conscious Spending** and **Automation** sections I will outline how you can make this as simple as possible.

### Parents don’t always have the answers

Most people learn everything they know about money from their parents. Most people see their parents as good with money. One of the first big leaps I had in terms of my understanding of finance was when I realised following my Mum’s stock investing philosophy was not the only way to go. Use what you have learnt from the people around you as a springboard to diving into the material yourself, there is a great deal to be learnt from others, and from your own mistakes.

### Understand your purpose

![png](/images/finance/purpose.jpeg)

Just like any of my goals, I like to attach a purpose to accumulating wealth. Ask yourself two questions (which I have stolen from Ramit Sethi): 

1. Why do you want to be rich?
2. What does being rich mean to you?

I would consider myself rich in life when I can achieve the following:

- Take my career in whatever direction I want to, without worrying about money
- Make sure my parents don’t have to worry about money again
- Be able to work for as long as I want on charitable causes
- Spend on the things that I love and share those experience with others	

I encourage you to make your own list of what you consider the ‘good life’; understanding the purpose beyond making money for money itself is crucial for achieving fulfillment. 


### Not all roads lead to Rome, but many roads lead to Dublin

I will refer to this theme again and again in the next two posts. 

**There are no absolutes in finance.**

Anyone who tells you their bank choice, asset allocation strategy, superannuation provider, or budgeting app is definitively the best is an idiot and should be ignored.

The saying “All roads lead to Rome” is not quite correct when it comes to finance, assuming ‘roads’ refers to financial strategy and ‘Rome’ refers to becoming wealthy. 

A lesser known but more apt adage coined by investor Taylor Larimore is that there are “more than one road to Dublin”. The roads again refer to your strategy. Dublin (which is a chuckle-worthy pun) can be whatever purpose that you (hopefully) considered in the last section. 

While there may be many roads to Dublin, some are **high-speed motorways** and some are **rocky country roads**. In the next two parts I will share how you can get on one of these motorways, a smooth and consistent way to reach the goal with less worry. It may not be the fastest way, but I’m convinced it's one of the best.

### Your biggest enemy

**Warning: cliche incoming!**

Yes, you may have guessed it, **you are the problem**. Not really, but read on for what I’m getting at.

Despite being amongst the highest income earners across the world, doctors are notorious for being terrible with money. The truth is that academic and occupational success are almost completely distinct from money management skills. In fact, being perceived as intelligent or successful may counterintuitively worsen one’s financial prospects. It is natural for these people to want to feel like they have some control, some unique insight which makes their financial decisions better than others. 

### Learning financial humility

![png](/images/finance/humility.png)

When you consider the reality that you are betting against firms that have hired hundreds of highly-credentialed analysts, spend billions in refining their portfolio allocation models, and **STILL manage to consistently underperform the market average**, you come to the understanding that sometimes the best path is the simplest one. 

There is a fine balance of financial humility that must be learned, which depends highly on your baseline confidence in your ability to manage finances. You may learn that you are **more** capable than you think in many areas and much  **less** capable than they think in others. In the **Investment** section I will share why my biggest mistakes in investing have been my most important lessons in guiding my overall investment philosophy. 

The second reason that you may be the biggest hindrance to accumulating wealth is simply the failure to ensure you meet your financial goals. Humans are idealistic but lazy. If you do not make sustainable commitments and consistently track your progress, you will probably not reach your target. Luckily, this does not mean you have to track every cent you spend on food or petrol. In fact if you set everything up correctly, you will probably be spending even less time on finances than you are now (See Part 4: **Automation** and **Tracking** ).
