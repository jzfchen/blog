# Banking

## Know your fees

Fees are the investor’s worst nightmare (other than themselves - as you have learnt in part 1). This will be a recurring concept in this series. 

In fact if you walk away right now with the one lesson learnt being to reduce your fees in everything: banking, investments, and super - **you potentially have already saved yourself hundreds of thousands in your lifetime** (trust me and read on for proof).

Every bank has fees; the most common are monthly account fees, overdraft fees, ATM fees (hopefully not with the Big Four network ATMs), and foreign transaction fees. The worst culprit is the overdraft fee - my bank charges $15 each day an overdrawing transaction occurs. 

We tend to obsess over small details like which bank has a slightly higher savings interest rate. Put into perspective, being charged two days ($30) of overdraft fee, would be the same as investing $1000 into a 2% interest rate account compared to a 5% account for one year. We treat that 3% difference as a big deal (which it is), so we should consider fees in the same way.

Go to Google, look up your bank name and the accounts you hold, and download the ‘Terms and Conditions’. Ctrl-F/Cmd-F “Fees” and make sure you understand what you are paying. If you are paying monthly account maintenance fees, understand under what conditions the fee is waived. Otherwise I would recommend you switch to a bank that doesn’t charge you monthly - see the next section for recommendations. 

## Choosing the best bank accounts

![png](/images/finance/bankchoice.png)

You know the difference between a transaction account and a savings account. I will show you how to make sure you are getting the most out of them. 

### A quality bank is worth more than the 0.1% bonus interest rate 
When considering any bank account, It is my firm belief that **usability and customer service are worth their weight in gold**. In 2018 I opened a Bank of Queensland account, attracted by its 4.00% p.a. savings rate which was nearly 2% higher than any of its competitors. Unfortunately the BOQ app and website are some of the worst pieces of user experience I have ever had the misfortune of dealing with. I would get locked out of my account frequently and have to call their poorly staffed service team, frequently have my transactions delayed, and their app only worked about half of the time, with none of the interactive features that most good banking apps have now (expense tracking, automated payments etc.). 

For me, **having to deal with a crappy bank is not worth the extra amount you make in interest**. You have to realise that some banks are able to offer slightly higher rates and lower fees precisely BECAUSE they cut costs on the service and maintenance side. **There are plenty of good banks with feature-rich apps, responsive customer service, AND competitive rates.**

### Beware the ‘Introductory’ and ‘Variable’ savings rates

You go on your bank’s website and you see ‘St. George Maxi Saver’ advertising a 5.35% p.a. Interest rate. Wow! That’s 0.5% higher than my current bank! 

Here’s what the terms and conditions say in small print.

> “The total introductory rate of 5.35% p.a. for the first 3 months is a combination of an introductory fixed interest rate of 3.90% p.a. and an online bonus rate of 0.35% p.a. on top of the standard variable rate, currently 1.10% p.a.”

I consider this to be a modern day banking scam. The RBA sets the cash rate on the first Tuesday of every month. This cash rate is currently 4.35%, and acts as a ‘guide’ for what banks should set their interest rates as. 

What this “introductory” deal is offering is essentially 3 months at this nice shiny 5.35% rate, and then **1.10% p.a. forever!** This is literally a quarter of what the RBA recommends! They are counting on the fact that most people don’t read the fineprint and don’t run the calculations on their interest so they don’t have to pay you as much interest. This ‘Maxi Saver’ account is an embarrassment and shouldn’t even be allowed to be offered.

So make sure when you look for a good savings account that the high interest rates are “Ongoing” rather than subject to an introductory period. Again, read the ‘Terms and Conditions carefully’. 

### Jumping through hoops

![png](/images/finance/hoop.png)

The second ‘trap’ is less of a trap but more of a convenience issue. Some banks will offer competitive ‘maximum variable’ interest rates, which are locked behind a bunch of conditions which are just inconvenient. 



Take the two above accounts. I use the ‘Ubank High Interest Save Account’. The rate is lower than the ‘ING Savings Maximiser’, but these rates are conditional on meeting the required monthly activities on the right, often known as “hoops”. 

I prefer the ubank saver over ING Savings Maximiser for 4 reasons:
1. I don’t want to fuss about making sure I’ve bought 5 things with that card each month 
2. I don’t want to be punished by losing interest if I make a big purchase or go on holiday 
3. The ING app sucks 
4. The ING card is super ugly (most important one)

Don’t get me wrong, the ING account is a great choice, given you don’t mind meeting those conditions every month and it doesn’t become mentally taxing to do so. 

Again, I want to reiterate there are no absolutes in anything finance related, know your priorities and adjust your choice accordingly. I don’t tend to hold much of my portfolio in cash, so usability is a massive priority for me currently. If my savings account balance was to swell to over $100,000 then I would definitely value the 0.5% extra interest rate more. The features I mentioned above may not be worth an extra $50 a year, but certainly worth $500 a year.

### Shut up and tell me what the good banks are!

This is a personalised choice, most people will be most comfortable with the bank they started off with, especially if they are a Big Four bank. I think it's a good idea to stick with that bank for your **transaction** account (as long as its low/zero fee), but strongly consider migrating your **savings account** to a bank with the best interest rate. 

Don’t have any loyalty towards a bank if they aren’t giving you the best service. It’s easy to migrate a balance and it can lead to thousands in extra savings over the years.

**In general I am more willing to tolerate poorer service/user experience for a savings account compared to a transaction account**, as you only deposit money once a month and don’t check the app as often. However if you go with a crap bank there will come a time you wished you picked one with better customer service. I would recommend a bank that is backed by/part of one of the Big 4 banks.

#### One of two great spreadsheets in this article

[Here is a spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/145iM6uuFS9m-Rul65--eFJQq_Au7Z_BA4_CwkYwu2DI/edit#gid=271791020) detailing the savings accounts available in Australia currently. Ignore the ones with “Honeymoon Rates”, they are the ones with the Introductory offers I mentioned earlier. 

Start by reviewing the ones with the highest rates. 
Exclude ones with restrictive “hoops” you aren’t willing to meet (X monthly transactions, grow savings every month etc.). 
Look online for reviews of the accounts, prioritising usability and service.
Open the account! Usually it is free and takes less than 30 minutes. 

Here are some popular high-interest savings accounts with reasonable “hoops”
1. **ING Savings Maximiser - 5.5%** (Great rate, mediocre service and bad app. Many more hoops - see above)
2. **UBank Savings Account - 5.1%** (Best app by far of the first four options, owned by NAB. Acceptable customer service)
3. **Bendigo Reward Saver - 5.25%** (Good rate, shit app. Needs to grow balance each month)
4. **St George Incentive Saver - 5.15%** (Good rate, disappointing service/app for a major bank)
5. **Up Bank - 4.35%** (Honourable mention - but not currently recommended. This used to be a good option because it has by far the best banking app features, but unfortunately the interest rates have not kept up with market rates - owned by Bendigo Bank)








# Investment: the practical guide

As you may know by now, I have an **unfortunate habit of yapping too much**. In fact I yapped so much that I had to move the first 2500 words of the Investment section to a separate article which you can read ["here"](https://jzfc.netlify.app/blog/finance5). 

The supplementary article discusses some important introductory concepts to investment and details my journey in investment and what I learnt from it. I include some insights on why I believe index fund investing is the best choice for most people. More importantly, the content of that article will be **referred to heavily when discussing how to optimise your superannuation**. If this interests you I would suggest you read through to understand the rationale behind my investment and super recommendations.

If you are a normal person and not a nerd then read on for the practical tips to investment.

## What even is an index fund?

An index fund is a type of investment fund that aims to replicate the performance of a specific market index, such as the S&P/ASX200. It achieves this by weighting the assets held by the fund based on its market capitalisation; If a company accounts for 30% of all the money in the market, the index fund will hold 30% of its money in that company’s shares. 

Investing in an index fund is generally the best option for retail investors - they provide strong returns, allow for great diversification, are simple to invest in, don’t require active trading, and have low fees. 

### Is it the same as an ETF?

You may have also heard of **exchange-traded funds (ETFs)** - they have quickly become the one of the most popular investment options for young people. 

An ETF is exactly what it sounds like - a fund invested in a certain set of companies, that is itself traded on the stock market. It will have a ticker code like any other stock (e.g. VGS, VAS, A200) and can be traded during the daily trading sessions (10am to 4pm in Australia). ETFs have a unit “price” which will replicate the returns of the index it is tracking. 

**ETFs aren’t necessarily the same as index funds.** An ETF can be an active managed fund. An ETF can be invested in companies from a specific sector, e.g. mining ETFs or resources ETFs. 

**Here’s a hypothetical example:** an ETF issuer like Vanguard invests $100,000 in a fund with an allocation that replicates the market (this is an index fund). It then creates 1000 shares of this total fund, each currently being worth $100. It lists them on the share market where investors like you and I can buy them. 

There are multiple benefits to investing in an ETF rather than an index fund directly. ETFs are generally easier to trade and can be bought directly on the stock exchange. There is no minimum investment and you can buy and sell however many units of the ETF you want. They are generally quite tax efficient too. 

## Fees, Fees, Fees! (again…)

Let’s return to our hypothetical fund worth $100,000. If the value of the fund grows next year to $110,000, the issuing company takes their cut first, known as a “management fee”. For a passive index fund, this is usually quite low, somewhere between 0.05-0.5%. This fee is incorporated into the price of the ETF; for a 0.2% fee the unit price of the ETF will now be $109.78. 

These fees can very slowly chip away at the profits that the investment has earned. Given that the ETFs all track the same indices, you are best off picking the index ETF with the  **lowest management fees**. 

## Investing internationally

While it is tempting to only invest in the domestic market, companies and sectors that we are familiar with, you must remember that Australia’s GDP makes up **less than 2%** of the entire world economy. 

Furthermore, every asset other than shares that we buy is **part of the Australian economy**, personal items, housing, bonds etc.

In this current age of globalisation, to be **truly diversified** and thus **protected against volatility**, we must ensure that we have allocated enough of our portfolio to international investments. 

It also feels cool to say that you have a share in massive companies like **Apple, Amazon, Meta, and Google!**

Fortunately investing in the international market is **easy**, there are index-based ETFs that track the world economy just like the ones that track the Australian economy.

Determining the percentage to allocate to the domestic vs international ETF is trickier and based on personal preference. The facts are that the international market has generally **delivered higher annual returns** than the Australian market, however is subject to **greater volatility.** However, as we have learnt, this risk is largely mitigated if we are investing over a long-term horizon, meaning young people benefit from choosing a more aggressive investment strategy.

As such, the most common splits between Australian:International ETFs are something like **30:70, 40:60, or 50:50**, allocating more towards the international stocks if you can tolerate more risk/have more time. 

## How to choose an ETF

Here are the rules you should follow:
1. **Make sure you are investing in an index-tracking ETF rather than a sector-specific or growth.** 
2. **Ignore fancy sounding ETFs** advertising 12% p.a. returns, these are the “smart-beta” or “factor-based”. You are paying higher fees for their fancy metrics and there’s no evidence they outperform index ETFs in the long run. **Past returns do not predict future ones.**
3. **Pick the index ETF with the lowest fees.** Vanguard index funds are my personal pick as they have low fees, and a cheap and convenient platform for investment (see next section)
4. **Search for the ticker name on Google.** Go on the issuers website and verify their management fee. Read through their holdings and make sure you understand where/how the fund invests its money. Make sure it tracks the index you think it does.

I have included a list below of trusted index ETF issuers alongside their management fees if you want to look yourself. Remember - low fees are the way to go!

["Finder - ETFs and their management fees"](https://www.finder.com.au/20-cheapest-etfs-on-the-asx)

## I am lazy. Tell me what the best international and domestic ETFs are!
 
My personal recommendation is to go for a **VAS:VGS split**, it is probably the most common one used by Australian ETF investors.
 
**VAS** tracks the returns of the top 300 companies listed on the ASX, a proxy for the Australian economy. You will recognise companies in its holding such as BHP, CBA, NAB etc. 

**VGS** tracks the world economy **excluding** Australia. I find these two ETFs fit nicely together and don’t overlap. It holds the biggest companies in the world: Apple, Microsoft, Amazon etc. 

My personal split is **30% VAS, 70% VGS** as I like to be more invested in the international market. However, if you are just beginning, 50:50 is a good place to start for simplicity. 

## What platform do I trade on?

The reason why I recommended Vanguard is because their ETFs are easy to trade using the **Vanguard Personal Investor** platform. When you buy and sell ETFs on a broker like Commsec or NABtrade, they will charge a **$10-20 “brokerage fee”**. This is substantial, if you are investing $1000 a month, **they’ve already pinched 2% of it! **

Vanguard Personal Investor is simple to use and features **no brokerage on purchasing Vanguard ETFs**, allows us to make the most of our money.

**NOTE VPI IS NOT CHESS-SPONSORED - This means it will not pre-fill in MyTax for your yearly tax return. They will release a tax statement for you every year to fill in (easy to follow)**

If you are investing with another ETF issuer like Betashares, other reliable platforms with $0 brokerage on ETFs include **CMC Invest**

### How often should I invest?

By now hopefully you have decided that you do want to buy index funds. A common discussion amongst investors is about the frequency and timing of investments. You may have heard the saying **_“Time in the market beats timing the market”_**. 

We can’t predict when the market will rise or fall month-to-month, so investing money as soon as it is available will provide better returns than waiting for the perfect opportunity, due to the compounding value of time. 

If you have never invested before, or have a large amount of money ready to invest now, known as a **lump sum**, it can be daunting to put it all in at once. Some people like to use a strategy called **dollar-cost averaging**, in which they split up the lump sum into 12 instalments and invest at the beginning of each month. The problem is that you are not earning interest on all the instalments until they are invested; this loss in compounding returns will likely be greater than what you would lose from buying an ETF at a high price. 

To those who think they can save up and then keep waiting for the cheapest opportunity to allow for the highest possible return, that is a nice fantasy but detached from reality. **Once again, I implore you to exercise financial humility and take the motorway, not the shortcut.**

When your paycheck comes in every month, it is a great habit to invest a proportion of that right away. Contrary to popular belief, this is not an example of dollar-cost averaging, it is actually monthly lump sum investment. Sticking to a monthly investment plan keeps you accountable, removes emotion from investment, and prevents the urge to attempt to target the cheapest price for your ETF, which will end up costing you big time. 

**You are not the market whisperer! Take your emotions out of it and invest monthly, this is a long-term game!**

If you don’t want to invest monthly then invest every two months or every quarter. Just make sure you have a plan that you stick to, instead of investing whenever you have some cash lying around, or you feel a burst of motivation (I have been guilty of this in the past). 

**Takeaways:**

- If you have a large lump sum now, just put it in, don’t stress about timing the market. 
- When investing part of your income as it comes in, stick to an investment plan, whether it be monthly, two monthly, or quarterly. Ignore the share price, we have longer term aspirations.

In the **Conscious Spending** section I will help you decide how much you will invest each month. In the **Automation** section I will show you how to automatically invest this amount in your ETFs of choice, so you can grow your portfolio monthly without lifting a finger.

### How often should I check my investment portfolio?

**Please do not obsess over the value of your portfolio.** This is a 20, 30, 40 year project, the current value doesn’t matter. Don’t lament over periods of economic downturn, you are not pulling money out. Don’t celebrate big wins, you are not pulling money out. 

In fact I don’t think you should be checking portfolio value at all except for three occasions: when you make monthly investments, tax time, and your yearly net worth review. You need to separate your emotions from ETF trading - think of it like another bank account. If it isn’t changing your plan, there’s no need to check constantly.

# Superannuation

Understanding and optimising how your super works is undoubtedly one of the most important steps towards maximising your retirement savings.

We’ve all seen the ads - “Same age, Same income, Same Super contribution”
But how can switching to the right super make you more money? 

Super is a long-term investment vehicle that has specifically been designed for retirement. When you work in Australia, your employer pays a proportion of your income to the super fund of your choice. 

Understanding your super means being able to take advantage of one of the **most powerful tools in your arsenal**, one that is **incredibly tax-efficient** and can offer superior gains to your non-super investments.

## Choose Passively Managed Super Products

Most super funds will offer a range of different products, including actively managed and passive funds. 

I want you to think about super as just another form of the funds we introduced in ["the supplementary article"](https://jzfc.netlify.app/blog/finance5); it offers both passive and actively managed super products. 

The actively managed funds are the **same** as the ones I discussed in the last section, often they hide behind names like “Growth Plus” or “Core Strategy”, but it’s really the same thing - hiring a fund manager and team to constantly evaluate the asset holdings. They thus suffer from the same problems as all actively managed funds - you are paying high management fees for average/below average performance.

Luckily for our journey down the “motorway to Dublin”, any good super fund will give you the freedom to determine your own asset allocation without relying on (and paying the salary of) a fund manager. You can allocate your super money in the same  International/Australian Index split that we discussed in the last section. 

**Passively managed super products are much cheaper** and replicate the stock market’s reliable returns, exactly like the index funds and ETFs we discussed earlier.

### An example case: how one switch can save you $200,000

Let’s take Rest Super, an industry fund that provides both passive and active super products. It also happens to be the fund I am with. 

I will focus on the most important fee for now - the **“investment fee”** - the rest will be discussed in the next section. The investment fee is the Big Daddy of all super fees. Using the default “Core Strategy” product that all fund members are on unless they switch, Rest takes a whopping 0.48% of **ALL your super savings** every single year. In fact Rest actually advertises themselves as **cheap** compared to some other funds like Australian Ethical, which has active management fees of 1.15% !!!! (skull emoji). 

If only we didn’t have to pay these greedy (and honestly useless) fund managers!!! Well lucky for you, the Boglehead’s Lord and Saviour cometh again - the index fund. Rest’s index tracking, passively managed products have a **0.00% investment fee!** And rightfully so, because you are your own fund manager! 

**Let’s work through the numbers using the government’s MoneySmart calculator and see how much you save, assuming these fees alone.**

Take two twins Pas (short for Passive Investment Fund) and Man (Short for Actively Managed Investment fund; their parents were big Warren Buffett fans). Both start work at 20, and are fortunate enough to make $150,000 a year until they retire at age 65. 

When he starts work, Pas goes into his Rest account settings and changes his strategy from the default “Core Strategy” to “Passive Index”, investing in a combination of US and Australian tracking index funds. Man trusts that Rest is a good super and leaves his with the default settings. 

We’ll give the active product the benefit of the doubt and assume they perform just as well as the passive product, which we know is not true in > 90% of cases. I’ll add on to both an extra $378 of fees per year, which is approximately the total of the administrative fees.

### Pas’ retirement savings
![png](/images/finance/Pas.png)

### Man’s retirement savings
![png](/images/finance/Man.png)

In this example, Pas has managed to **save almost $200,000 in fees** just by changing his super fund asset allocation to a passively managed one. And this is assuming that Rest’s active management meets market returns, which we know from historical data is extremely unlikely!

## Which super do I pick?

Ok, you’ve you want to go for a super and go with the passive, index-tracking products. 

We’ve already discussed the most important fee - investment fees.

So do yourself a favour and make sure whatever super you go with it satisfies three conditions:

1. It has products that track International and Australian indices
2. It is passively managed (assumed by point 1)
3. It has the lowest fees possible

[Here is the bible](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sR0CyX8GswPiktOrfqRloNMY-fBlzFUL/edit#gid=814241220) of Australian superannuation comparison. I suggest you review this document carefully, the most useful columns are the “Total fees for given super balance” ones. Anything dark blue is excellent, the lower the total fee the better. 

The two obvious standouts are the **Rest and Hostplus** passive funds - they would be my recommendation. My personal choice was Rest as it has 0.00% investment fees for both Australian and International investments, and my super fund portfolio skews towards international investments, which Hostplus charges a higher fee for. It also has a $300 cap on Admin fees, but that is less important.

If you do sign up for Rest, you will need to do three things:

1. Inform your employer you have changed your super (Use the ATO's 'Standard Choice Form')
2. Consolidate your previous super fund with Rest
3. Change your asset allocation from “Core Strategy” to your desired split of the ‘Australian Shares - Indexed’ and ‘Overseas Shares - Indexed’ products. I go with 30:70 as I am already relatively exposed to the Australian equity markets through the rest of my portfolio.

I don’t have an account with other super funds but I assume it would be very similar. Note there may be a fee for switching investment options if you already have a balance with a fund. 

And there it is, one simple trick to potentially saving hundreds of thousands in your li

## Voluntary concessional contributions - Super's Superpower

Your employer must pay a proportion of your salary to your super fund to contribute to your retirement. However, you can also make additional voluntary payments into your super, known as concessional contributions.

I think everyone should understand how these concessional contributions are taxed - and how to utilise it a way that **is almost guaranteed to beat any long-term investment you make**.

Concessional contributions are taxed at **15%**. There is a cap on these contributions, currently $27,500, after which additional contributions will be taxed at a higher rate. This cap includes what your employer has contributed on your behalf. 

If you can afford it, you should try to **reach this concessional cap every single year**. This is often referred to as **maxing out your super**. 

The reason is because the tax saving on this contribution **far exceeds any realistic investment return**. 

### Let me show you using an example.

Let's say you make $150,000 a year. Your employer contributes the minimum 11%, which is $16,500. This means you can voluntarily contribute another $11,000. 

Australia operates under a progressive tax system in which income in higher tax brackets is taxed at a higher rate. If you spend, save, or invest this $11,000 dollars, it will be taxed at your marginal rate of 37%. By contributing it towards your super (below the cap), this $11,000 goes from being taxed at 37% to 15%. This why super is referred to as very **tax-efficient**.

Taxed at marginal rate of 37%: $11,000 becomes $6930

Taxed at 15% super rate: $11,000 becomes $9350

This is an instant point-of-purchase gain of **35%**. No investment you were going to make with that money will ever reliably generate that amount.

And the beautiful part is that if you've set up your super correctly, this all goes straight into your desired allocation of international and Australian stocks anyway. If you were going to invest that $11,000 you've basically made 35% instantly.

### Why doesn't everyone max out their super?

Super can only be taken out of the account for free once you've reached your 'preservation age', which will be around 60 for our generation. The main argument against maxing out your super is that you are locking away money that you won't be able to use for decades.

If you were planning to invest that money and not touch it, that shouldn't be a problem. But for some, having that sum of money to spend on daily expenses and luxuries while they are young is worth more than the tax benefits which can only be reaped once you are in your 60s. 

My recommendation is that you should **only max out your super if you have a consistent, relatively high income that means you can live comfortably even after the maximum contribution**. 

Don't live on baked beans and toast just to be able to afford to max it out. As I will discuss in the **Conscious Spending** section, the best way to invest is one that is sustainable for the future and doesn't encroach on how you want to live a good life. 

## Actionable Steps: Part 2

### Banking

1. Search online for your bank accounts and understand the fee structure
2. Compare your banks savings interest rates with others available. 
3. Make the switch if you are paying too many fees, losing out on the rate, or want better service and usability

### Investment
1. Look for low management fee index funds. Find one that tracks the domestic market and one that tracks tha international market - e.g. VAS and VGS
2. Search the ticker codes online, understand what you are investing in - hint look at "Holdings"
3. Set up an account with a broker/platform with $0/low brokerage fees. I recommend Vanguard Personal Investor. Bonus points if they have an auto-invest feature
4. If you have a lump-sum ready to invest, do it now. 
5. Decide whether you want to invest your income monthly, two-monthly, or quarterly

### Super
1. Understand your super. Do they have indexed domestic and international products?
2. Check your super fees (see spreadsheet). Make sure you are not getting fleeced.
3. Switch to a different super (I recommend Rest or Hostplus) if yours does not satisfy the above
4. Log onto your super website and change the investment options to the indexed ones (default will be managed)
5. Transfer your existing super balance over and let your employer know.
6. Bonus: consider voluntary contributions to your super if your income allows
