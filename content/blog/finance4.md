# Automation

![png](/images/finance/conveyor.png)
By now you’ve hopefully set up all your accounts and made a starter plan on how each dollar you earn is going to be spent.

Finally we can get to my favourite part, the part that separates this guide from most beginner finance guides - **Automation**

People are incredibly lazy. I’m lazy too. That’s why I get my system to do all the work for me.

Why not put in a little effort now so you can be even lazier later? All while being able to grow your investment accounts, savings, and still enjoy the things you love. 

This is the part of the guide that allows me to justify the “Minimalist” in the title. A way for money to flow into its appropriate destination without you lifting a finger. 

If you get this up and running you’re going to feel like Steve Jobs amongst a herd of flip-phone users. 



### Pros and cons to automation:

Pros

1.  **It makes finance less of a chore**. It is 2024, wake up. It’s time to let the machines do the boring things. If a monkey can be trained to do it then your time is better spent doing other things.
2. **It removes emotion from finance**  Remember what I said about financial humility? If you’re like me, at some point in your investing life you’re going to say some dumb shit like “the market is overvalued right now” or “I don’t want to buy because it hasn’t reached the bottom yet”. By automating your investments you don’t get the opportunity to disrupt your long-term financial goals with your short-sighted emotions. You’re playing the long game. 
3. **It improves book-keeping** - you will know exactly which day of the month your bills are due, which days you transferred to other accounts, because that’s how you designed it.
4. **It holds you accountable** - perhaps the most important point. There will be much more friction in taking that $30 labelled “Mum birthday” out of your savings than with you deciding to put it in. Automation helps with discipline. 

Cons

1. **Fluctuating/unpredictable income.** If your income fluctuates every week you have to recalculate the proportions every week. A very fair argument, 20% of a paycheck may look like very different amounts for a wage worker or freelancer. Remember however that the 20% is just an estimate, it doesn’t have to be exact.
2. **A technical reason**: when you set up an auto-invest it is executing something called a “market order” rather than a “limit order”. This means it will buy the stock at the cheapest price someone is selling it for, which means you will pay a slight premium. This is not a big deal with high volume ETFs but should be considered nonetheless for completeness.
3. **You like to do these money transfers yourself.** Understandable, but slightly weird. Please continue. 

**Let’s get started.**


## Understanding automation features

The first thing you need to know is that most banking apps and platforms have some very powerful features that can make your money management very simple. 

### Scheduled and recurring bank transfers

Let’s say you open a ING Savings Maximiser, which requires a $1,000 deposit every month to activate the maximum savings rate. Instead of setting a reminder on your phone, why not just instruct your transaction account bank to transfer it to your ING account on the 1st of every month? 

Most banks have this feature. Here’s how to set it up for the most popular banks:

[“CBA”](https://www.commbank.com.au/support.digital-banking.set-up-regular-netbank-transfers.html), [“Westpac”](https://www.westpac.com.au/personal-banking/online-banking/making-the-most/recurring-payments/), [“ANZ”](https://www.anz.com.au/support/make-change-future-payments/), [“NAB”](https://www.nab.com.au/help-support/personal-banking/manage-account/setting-up-regular-payments), [“St George”](https://www.stgeorge.com.au/online-services/internet-banking/regular-payments), [“ING”](https://campaigns.ing.com.au/fastlane/how-to-manage-scheduled-payment).

### Direct debit

You probably know what a direct debit is. If your gym or phone company takes money from your account every month without you having to pay them, then you already have it set up.

If you still have to manually pay for a service every month, look into setting up direct debit with them directly.

### Auto-investing 

Here’s where we get into the meaty stuff. If you are the type who likes to verify every purchase then I recommend manually investing your money every month. Consult your broker’s FAQs on how to do this, it will involve a bank transfer to a cash management account with them, followed by placing an order of your particular ETF. 

If you’ve never invested before, it may be a good idea to **learn how to fund your account and buy and sell shares before diving straight into automation**. 

Otherwise if you trust me when I say that ignoring the price and investing ritualistically every month will lead to the best returns, then a hassle-free way to invest is via **Vanguard Personal Investor’s Auto-Invest function**.

#### Vanguard Personal Investor Auto-Invest

Vanguard Personal Investor is Vanguard’s own platform where you can buy and hold the issuer’s ETFs for very low cost. If you want to buy other ETFs then you need to look for a broker that has this auto-invest function like Superhero.

**Here’s a worked example of how I set my auto-invest up:**

Let’s say I’ve decided to invest $1000 (10%) of my $10000 monthly pay, with a 30% VAS, 70% VGS split. 

This comes out to be $300 in VAS and $700 in VGS. 

1. On Vanguard Personal Investor click “Auto invest” and add VAS and VGS to your plan. 
2. On the next screen, type in $300 next to VAS and $700 next to VGS. 
3. Choose a frequency and a start date - I suggest monthly, and choose a date a couple days after your pay cycle to make sure you have money in your bank account.
4. Set up a direct debit so it takes money from your bank account automatically after you are paid.

While you’re there go to your holdings and change what Vanguard does with your dividends from “Cash” to “Reinvest”. This means you can use the dividend income to automatically grow your portfolio, instead of sitting in your cash account.

**A few notes regarding auto-investing:**

1. Trades will only be executed when the ASX is open between 10am-4pm Monday to Friday
2. ETFs can only be purchased in whole units. If VGS is trading at $100 and you invest $750, you will buy 7 units and the extra $50 will be deposited in a cash account.
3. With regards to Market orders vs Limit orders, I use the Auto-invest and I have noticed dramatically different prices. For me, a 0.1% once off premium (<$1) is worth not having to spend hours each month trying to get the best price (which is luck anyway). Look at the bigger picture.
4. VPI is not CHESS-sponsored. This essentially means you will have to manually lodge your taxes on your ETF holdings. Fortunately, it’s pretty straightforward.
5. There is a minimum auto-invest amount of $200. Consider changing your investment frequency to quarterly to meet this minimum if you don't meet the $200. 


## Putting it all together: Otto Automatic’s Pipeline

![png](/images/finance/otto3.png)

Otto Automatic loves automation. He puts everything in his life on autopilot, including his finances. Let’s follow the fate of each dollar in his paycheck. Otto has three bank accounts: A CBA transaction account, A ubank transaction account, and a ubank savings account.

**1st of the month**: Otto gets paid into his Commonwealth Bank Transaction Account

**2nd of the month**: Otto has several automatic transfers set up. 10% of his paycheck gets sent to his high-interest savings account with ubank. This also activates the 5.1% bonus variable rate for the month. 30% of his pay is sent to the associated ubank transaction account for guilt-free spending.

**5th of the month**: Otto has chosen this date for Vanguard’s Auto invest direct debit. This is to ensure some leeway in case there have been some problems releasing his pay on time. 15% of his paycheck is debited and automatically invested, half into VGS and half into VAS.

The last 45% stays in the CBA transaction account. He uses his CBA account for his fixed costs: his direct debit bills (phone, internet, gym), rent, groceries, medical expenses, transport etc.

He uses his ubank transaction account to pay for his wants - he is able to track separately how much he has left to spend on fixed costs (CBA account) and his discretionary costs (ubank account). 

Change the 1st to whatever day you get paid. If you are paid twice a month, this can be organised with the 1st and 15th as starting dates. 

**Here’s a flowchart of Otto’s money flow:**

**You may mix and match which parts of this automation process works for you** - don’t feel like you have to replicate it exactly. 


# Tracking

You are now operating on autopilot when it comes to your paycheck. The first few months will need a lot of tweaking but once you hit that sweet spot you can stop worrying about money and focus on the things that matter. 

Set the system up for a few months. How does it feel? Are you allocating too little or too much to certain areas?

Beyond tweaking spending, there is value in tracking the overall progress of your finances which I will share with you in the next few sections. 

## Tracking savings goals

If you have some medium or long term goals such as saving for a holiday, home deposit, or that watch you’ve been eyeing up, make sure to track your savings progress. 

You should aim to do this **every 3 or 6 months**. Too often and it will feel like a chore and too infrequently and you might miss your goals all together.

This can be done with a simple Excel spreadsheet, put in your savings balance at different timepoints and graph it. Does the line look like it's going to reach your goal? This may give you some bonus motivation to save a little more. 

It can also help you realise when you have more savings than you expect, which you might use for further savings goals, investments, or maybe just to reward yourself for your hard work. 

Realising you are not meeting your savings goals can also prompt you to inspect your spending habits more critically. 

## Rebalancing your investment portfolio

This is a little more complex but another concept you will come across eventually in your investment journey. When you start investing you have a goal of maintaining a ratio of domestic to international index ETFs. 

However the value of ETFs will change with time as their respective markets change; despite you consistently investing half of your money into international stocks and half into domestic, the balance will never quite be 50:50. 

**If we want to maintain our desired asset allocation, we have to make some changes!**

### A worked example

Let’s say every month I invest $100 into VGS  (international) and $100 into VAS (domestic). In the last year, the Australian market has had a great performance, rising 30%. Unfortunately, the international stock market has fallen 20%. Even though I’ve put in $1200 into each ETF, here is how much my portfolio is currently worth:

| ETF | Value |
|---|---|
|VGS|960| 
|VAS|1560|
|Total|2520|

Now pick up your pen and do the maths with me.

We targeted a 50:50 distribution. VGS makes up 960/2520 = 38% of our portfolio, while VAS makes up 1560/2520 = 62% of our portfolio. 

If we leave this as it is and just keep investing the same amount into each ETF, eventually it’s going to be **dominated by VAS**. By deviating away from our desired portfolio allocation, we are not investing in ETFs the way which we have designed, which is to optimise growth. So its very important we **reset this balance** back to the way it was.

#### How and when to rebalance your portfolio

I recommend you evaluate your portfolio every **6-12 months**. Set a date in your calendar - you are going to forget. If at that point you calculate your portfolio percentage allocation is off by **more than 5%**, we begin the rebalancing process.

The easiest way to do this is just to pause payments into one of the ETFs while maintaining payments into the other one. You can even double your payments into the ETF that is lagging behind which will rebalance it quicker. Check in every **two months or so** until the balance is restored, at which point you should restart the payments into the ETF with higher than desired allocation. Set a reminder for this too - you will forget!

## Net worth tracking

![png](/images/finance/net.png)

Net worth is a term we often associate with billionaires on Forbes articles, but it is an important metric that we can track for ourselves.

Net worth is an easy calculation in theory: Add up your cash, investments, super, other assets, and subtract your debt.

You should try to estimate this around once a year, it is not a priority but when you accumulate a lot of assets and liabilities it can be good to get a sense of your financial position.

### Why is it important to track net worth?

1. **Retirement planning.** Although you might not be planning for retirement now, net worth tracking is essential to ensure you are on the right track to retire at the age you want with enough income. There is a rule of thumb known as the **4% rule**, which states that you can live comfortably off 4% of your retirement savings yearly for 30 years. If you plan to retire with a retirement income of **$80,000**, that means you will want to accumulate **$2,000,000** by retirement. As such you will need to alter your savings and investment plans accordingly.
2. **It allows long term financial health assessment** Often when we have a very complex investment - think real estate, with many sources of income, many expenses, and large loans, it can be hard to know whether we are actually increasing our worth over a long period.
3. **It can motivate you.** Most people graduate university with a negative net worth. Seeing that line rise from the depths and start to exponentially grow may be rewarding to some.
4. **Debt management.** If you have substantial debt, calculating and tracking your net worth annually helps put into perspective the size of this debt, and whether it is manageable. It may be an uncomfortable realisation for a university graduate to realise that despite accumulating $30,000 in savings that **their worth is still in the negatives**, but it is important to be realistic.

## Accountability

Let’s be honest, there are some things in this guide that even if you wanted to implement, you are going to. You might even have read the whole thing and not done a single thing.

I can understand that. **Financial inertia is a real thing**. Past results and statistics don’t predict the future, and there’s no way to definitively prove that what I’m recommending will be better than what you already have in place. I hope there have been some principles and concepts that you have learnt that you had not come across before, and someday they will motivate and guide your decision towards making the best financial choice. 

If you do implement these steps, you have to **hold yourself accountable to continue**. As I keep reiterating, this is a **long term game**. By allowing yourself to spend on the things you love, while cutting on the things you don’t need, we make it more likely to be sustainable. By making things automated we take out a lot of the effort, but there are still many things you have to do manually. 

Whatever system you end up establishing, **be consistent, and track your progress**.
 Seeing your net worth reverse from the negatives and climb steadily can be one of the best motivators. 


## Quick words on other topics

### There are many roads to Dublin

I’m not going to write about other approaches like real estate, bonds, and cryptocurrency. These are all viable strategies. What I’ve described is what I believe to be one of the motorways - one of the fast and simple ways to reach your goal. 

#### Some common finance rules which may guide you in your journey
-  **28% rule**: Total spending on housing (mortgage, rental, maintenance, tax, fees etc) should be kept under 28%. Not sure if this is realistic in a major city
- **55% rule**: If you are renting your property out, multiply gross rental by 55% to find net operating income (accounts for maintenance, insurance, fees, tax, vacancies)
- **Rule of 72**: Take 72 and divide it by the return rate of a particular investment. That is how many years it will take to double at that rate
- **Life insurance**: Consider life insurance 5x your gross income for adequate protection
- **20% Deposit**: If possible, aim for a deposit of at least 20% to avoid private mortgage insurance (PMI) and potentially secure better mortgage terms (may be waived in some exceptions)

### Debt

We’re fortunate in Australia that we don’t have this weird culture around credit cards and debt so most people won’t have debt problems. The biggest debt that most people have is their HECS debt, which is sometimes referred to as a “good debt”. 

A very common question asked is, how should I prioritise paying off my credit card debt? What about my home loan? What about my HECS debt?

**Let me give you a very simple way to approach debt.**

Most debt is in the form of a “reducible balance loan”. This means the interest is calculated on the current balance owing and not the original balance. Simply put, using money to pay off that balance means that money no longer has interest charged on it.

So if your loan is at 5% p.a., using money to pay it off is **equivalent to making 5% return on that same money**. 

All you need to do is ask yourself, is the loan interest rate **higher** than the return I could generate on this same money? 

Obviously there are many, many other factors at play. If your method of generating the return is risky, you might not be guaranteed that. Additionally, paying off loan quickly may mean your borrowing power is increased, which is important if you are considering buying a house soon.

### HECS Debt Misconceptions

What about HECS debt? Should I put all my savings into paying it off?

I’ve seen many people around me claim things like **“I have to pay off my HECS debt quickly before it gets indexed too much!”**

It was scary seeing my HECS debt increase by 7% last year, and it is disheartening contributing to a loan and seeing the balance only grow.

I urge you to apply the same logical principles to analysing what you should do with HECS. 

**Here’s my take.** 

HECS debt does not have interest charged on it, instead it is indexed based on changes in the CPI, a proxy for inflation. The Reserve Bank of Australia influences the interests on loans and savings every month, with one of its primary objectives being to keep inflation between 2-3%. 

Due to the RBA’s efforts, inflation is set to fall from a peak of 8% in 2022 to around 3% by 2025 (see graph). HECS indexation will likely fall accordingly. I believe it is **unlikely that we will see average indexation rates above 5% in the next 5 years**. We may get a couple years of ~4-5% indexation, but after that it should fall back to the 2-3% which has been the trend.

![png](/images/finance/rba.png)

Using a lump sum to pay off my HECS debt would be equivalent to investing in a financial product with 2-3% guaranteed returns. Obviously we can’t predict what happens in the next 10 years, but my opinion is that I am much more likely to generate higher returns by investing in the stock market, which is likely to provide 7-8% returns in the same time period.

This decision is supported by a couple of additional considerations. 

1. **HECS repayments aren't as "mandatory" as other debt.** HECS does not need to be paid if you lose your job, or don’t earn enough. This is different to a usual loan, which will collect regardless of your income. If some massive personal or economic event occurs, the money I used to pay down my HECS is gone. If I didn’t invest it, I can still pull it out and use it, while also not needing to contribute regular instalments
2. Morbid, but **HECS is written off on your death**. If you are to die with normal debt, that is paid out of your estate - your cash, shares, real estate etc. If you die with HECS, it doesn’t have to be paid.

The main two reasons to pay off your HECS early would be:
1. **You don’t want debt hanging over your head.** This is actually really reasonable - there is definitely a psychological effect of knowing you have money that you owe. Some people would like to pay everything off and start with a net worth of 0 instead of maximising their return, all power to them.
2. **You want access to greater borrowing power.** Whenever you want to borrow money, such as for a home loan, a lender will need to evaluate your debt liabilities. HECS is one of these. This means you won’t be able to borrow as much money for a house. If you are planning to buy a property soon, it is not unreasonable to prioritise paying off your HECS debt to maximise your borrowing power and thus leverage. 

As such, I suggest you think about your future goals, your prediction of future indexation rates, and your job security when you make the decision to prioritise investing or paying off HECS.

## Actionable Steps: Part 4

### Automation

1. Understand how to use the key automation features: scheduled/recurring bank transfers, direct debit, and auto-investment.
2. Set them up to automatically transfer your money where it needs to go. This will remove friction and help automatically implement your spending plan.
3. Tweak the proportions week to week. You may find that you've allocated too little or too much for your own spending. Make the change for the following month and see how it feels.
4. Relax - it has been a long process! Reap the rewards of time savings, greater accountability, and lower financial stress. 

### Tracking
1. Track the progress of your long term savings goals every 3-6 months. Are you on target? Do you need to save more? Where is that money coming from?
2. Evaluate your portfolio to see if it needs rebalancing every 6-12 months. If the assets are off your target allocation percentage by greater than 5%, consider rebalancing. 
3. Track your net worth. Get the calculator out and estimate it by subtracting your liabilities (HECS debt, home loan etc.) from your assets (cash, investments, super, real estate, personal effects etc.). Evaluate if you are on track for the retirement you are planning for.
4. Hold yourself accountable. Don't skip two months of savings or investments unless there is a good reason.
5. Understand that there will be unforeseen personal and economic events and plan accordingly. Remember that we have longer term aspirations and continue where possible, but be flexible where necessary.

## Wrapping up

Thank you for reading this ridiculously long guide. I have spent **20+ hours over the last 4 days** writing down basically everything I know about finance.

If even one person gets all the way through I will consider it a **massive success**. And if that one person learns a single thing I will be beyond happy. 

I hope this guide has shown you that finance doesn’t need to be scary or hard. By investing the time in learning the basic concepts underlying personal finance, you are already further ahead than most of the Australian population. **Remember, your youth is your superpower!**

Trust me, the effort you put into optimising your banks and super, developing a spending plan, and automating your finances will be well worth the few hours you put in. 

I hope you enjoyed the read. Please message me if you want to chat about anything finance; I can’t promise I’ll know the answer but I’d love to learn it together. If I’ve gotten anything glaringly wrong, I’m sorry, let me know and I will fix it.

And as promised, the required reading list. These books are awesome if you are interested in personal finance. I've made it a habit to read at least one book on finance a year and they have paid off massively. Don’t trust anything I’ve said here without verifying it yourself.

## Resource List

**‘I Will Teach You to Be Rich’ - Ramit Sethi**. Awesome place to start and where I’ve based a lot of this guide off. Comes across as a bit of a dickhead sometimes but his advice and philosophy is great.

**’The Barefoot Investor’ - Scott Pape**. Great entry level book targeted towards Australians. Where I first learnt about the great super scam. Doesn’t speak about investments much but is a very well structured and approachable guide towards getting out of the debt/poverty cycle.

**’The Psychology of Money’ - Morgan Housel**. Lessons about the unpredictable ways we can sometimes treat money. Explores our illogical approach to risk, fallacious financial behaviours, and stresses the importance of financial humility.

**’The Millionaire Next Door’ - Thomas J. Stanley and William D. Danko.** Based on their research on millionaires in the US and their habits, demonstrating that wealth is more often created through frugal lifestyles, sound low-risk investments, and focus on education, rather than the flashy entrepreneurship and risk-taking we see in the media. 

**’The Little Book of Common Sense Investing’ - Jack Bogle**. The founder of Vanguard who had been toting the value of index funds before they even existed. Quite technical but worth a read for the principles alone.

**‘The Intelligent Investor’ - Benjamin Graham**. The father of value investing, mentor to many greats including Warren Buffett. His principles described are as important as ever, but are less important if you will just buy ETFs.

In general, as you become more invested in the market you will start to be more interested in economic trends. Questions will pop up naturally: why are my US stocks falling when Australian stocks are rising? What’s the impact on this war on the mining sector? How does this tax affect my net earnings? Let that curiosity take you away, it is the best way to learn over a lifetime.
