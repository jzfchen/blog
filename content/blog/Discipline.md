In the 1960s, Stanford professor Walter Mischel began a series of psychological experiments on children investigating the strategies that preschool-aged children would use to resist temptation. Now famously known as the _‘Marshmallow Test’_, Mischel and his team would bring each child into a room, place a marshmallow in front of them and offer them a deal before leaving for 15 minutes; eat the marshmallow now, or wait until the researcher returned and be rewarded with two marshmallows. 

The experiment was a test of **‘delayed gratification’** - the ability to forgo an immediate reward for a larger future payoff. I’m sure you’ve seen footage of the original experiment or the many attempts to recreate it - some kids ate the marshmallow without a single thought as soon as the researcher stepped out. Others were able to resist for a few minutes before they began squirming, fidgeting, covering their eyes, before finally giving in to temptation. A select few children were able to last the entire 15 minutes and were deservingly rewarded with their second marshmallow. 

The more fascinating results, however, came decades later, as researchers closely followed the children as they progressed through their schooling and adult life. The children who were able to delay gratification demonstrated **higher academic performance, peer-rated maturity, and social competence** as teenagers. As adults, they were less likely to suffer from substance abuse problems, be divorced, or be overweight. In fact, there was a direct correlation between the self-control of children **30 years prior** and their future body weight; each additional minute the children waited predicted a 0.2 reduction in BMI. 

## Delayed Gratification: Nature or Nurture

The numerous longitudinal studies conducted on this original cohort has demonstrated that the **ability to delay gratification from an early age is clearly correlated with achieving success in later life**. We’ve experienced this organically in our own lives and in our observation of others - delaying relaxing in favour of going to the gym helps you achieve a healthy body, delaying gaming or scrolling on your phone means you’re more likely to study and achieve higher grades. 

An interesting question is raised from these findings: **Is an individual’s self-control and ability to delay gratification a trait defined at birth? Or is it a skill that can be built up, developed, and harnessed to achieve success?**

More than 40 years after the initial Stanford study, Kidd and colleagues investigated this question by replicating the experiment with a twist. The children were split into two groups. In the first group, children were promised rewards like stickers and crayons if they waited, but after the time had elapsed, they were never given their prizes (poor kids…). In the second group, they were fairly rewarded if they managed to delay their gratification sufficiently. 

The findings were clear: children who were reliably rewarded waited significantly longer when re-tested, than those who were unreliably rewarded. Those in the first group had formed negative associations and beliefs about delayed gratification - “Even if I wait I am not going to be rewarded”. In contrast, kids in the second group were subconsciously learning that they were both capable of waiting for the reward, and that it was worth waiting for.

The takeaway from this experiment is that self-control and delayed gratification is indeed a **learned behaviour**, and is greatly affected by our surroundings, our past experiences, and our personal evaluation of the reliability and value of the rewards provided. **That is to say, we are able to train our brains to exercise greater self-restraint and delay gratification, as well as modify our environment and reward structure to facilitate this.**

## Motivation, Discipline, and Willpower

I want to begin with a discussion of these three concepts. Before you roll your eyes, I too think it is insufferable to listen to the host of fitness influencers, self-help gurus, and finance experts preach about the value of these traits in an attempt to sell their latest online course. I do however think there is immense value in developing a clear personal understanding of these deeply human ideals and how they may contribute to your life.

**Motivation** is the simplest to understand. Motivation is the consequence of a primal instinct driven by our ancient dopaminergic system - our motivations can often be traced to some innate biological drive to obtain power, status, sexual desirability, just like our evolutionary ancestors were driven to obtain food, shelter, and to reproduce. As humans, our motivations have developed more complexity but I believe they are not far distanced from simple biological urges. Motivation is hard-wired in our species. it is powerful, beautiful, and irreplaceable. Yet motivation cannot be solely relied on to achieve our goals; it is just as fleeting and unreliable as it is transformative. 

**Discipline** refers to the work ethic you apply to your actions and is independent of motivation. Discipline allows you to conduct yourself in a way that moves you closer to your goals, regardless of your underlying motivation or lack thereof. In simpler terms, discipline represents a careful control of the actions one performs, even when they do not have the motivation to do so. Discipline, in a way, is likely a product of our evolution; the ability to forgo immediate satisfaction of biological needs for a greater future reward may be ultimately beneficial for survival. Humans exhibit advanced levels of self-control; it requires high level executive cortical functions that simply have not developed in other species. 

**Willpower** is closely related to discipline, and reflects the resistance of short-term temptations in the pursuit of long-term goals. Any task that requires high levels of discipline is inherently a challenge to one’s willpower; controlling the course of action requires one to steer clear of more accessible replacement activities.

**The interplay between these three ideals are critical in determining the likelihood of achieving success.** As mentioned, motivation is incredibly powerful but grossly limited by its unpredictability - someone could feel a rush of motivation to get fitter and eat healthier, only to snooze their alarm 5 times the next morning. Without the discipline to get out of bed and make it to the gym, our activities and success would be ruled by the ebbs and flows of motivation. If motivation is the ephemeral zephyr that propels the vessel of ambition, then discipline is the dependable rowing crew which sustains its purposeful trajectory in periods of dead calm. 

While motivation cannot produce satisfactory results without the steadfast guidance of discipline, discipline alone without adequate purpose is doomed from the beginning. One who exercises discipline devoid of sufficient motivation is akin to a vessel with no destination, a ship with no captain. 

Every journey towards fulfilment must therefore begin with a clear examination of **one’s true priorities**, the person you want to become, the life you want to live. While this might seem obvious to many, I can count on one hand the number of times I have sat down for 30 minutes and honestly pondered what the purpose of my life is. Having lived only 25 years, I cannot claim to fully understand my life’s purpose, yet it is my duty to identify the priorities of the person I am now, as the present self is the only true “me” that will exist. 

One’s motivation is unique; the timing and strength of its impulses and calls-to-action can not be controlled. Discipline, however, is entirely in one’s control. It is the cultivation of habits and mindsets of discipline and willpower that will support the slow trek towards purposeful living, with an open willingness to change course as new inspirations, realisations, and life events take place. 

## Why should we live a life of discipline and self-control?

Let me summarise in clear terms why one should live a disciplined life and build their willpower. We are all motivated by different things, shaped by our personalities, influences, and life experiences. From those motivations emerge goals, some short-term and some that span a lifetime, each requiring **specific actions** that progress one towards the goals. 

**Motivation, no matter how powerful or intense, is nonetheless fleeting**. It is discipline that provides the structure to continue these goal-directed actions when motivation wanes, and willpower that prevents us from straying off the course. Discipline is the one element we can control and rely on in the pursuit of our goals. If one values achievement of their personal goals and thus fulfilment, they should thus strive to cultivate discipline and willpower to the best of their abilities.

**This is not to say that living an extremely disciplined life is the only pathway to fulfilment.** An individual’s goals are **not equal** in importance. One may choose to practise greater discipline in actions that further one goal but not others. If the importance of academic success outweighs physical strength, one may exert more discipline in maintaining a study routine over a gym routine. However, **discipline and self-control are transferable skills** - cultivating discipline in the pursuit of one goal will inevitably cause you to be disciplined in other areas of life. It is no coincidence that the children from Mischel’s Marshmallow experiment who exhibited greater self-control from an early age went on to become more successful in physical, occupational, and personal life. 

## How does one cultivate discipline and willpower?

![1](/images/discipline/3.png)

One does not need to seek to become some infallible spiritual being to cultivate discipline and willpower. Below I detail some actionable, research-based methods to develop these skills.

### 1. Tap into the innate predisposition for habit formation

In my opinion, the best way to develop discipline in your actions is to **utilise our species’ predisposition for forming habits and routines**. The human brain has the task of processing an innumerable number of immensely difficult tasks with a limited number of neurons. Biology’s solution was for the brain to constantly rewire itself to be **hyper-efficient**, spending minimal energy on often repeated tasks. The phenomenon that results is habit formation -  any routine that is consistently reproduced and provides adequately sufficient reward (in the form of dopamine) is likely to be continually reinforced and become automatic. 

If we want to practise discipline, isolating desire and motivation from action, developing and refining positive habits is a perfect solution. An individual must consider the actions that contribute towards their goals and purpose, and work backwards to develop the habits that will allow discipline in conducting these actions. 

In my [Dopamine Detox](https://jzfc.netlify.app/blog/dopaminedetox/) post I have already touched upon the concept of the habit loop - the neurological loop that governs the formation of habits. For those who are interested, James Clear’s ‘Atomic Habits’ is an absolute must-read for detailed actionable steps to developing and maintaining habits. All habits are ultimately governed by four elements: **cue, craving, action, and reward** - each of which can be targeted to improve habit formation and thus enhance discipline. I will summarise some of these methods below.

#### Make it obvious
Just as environmental cues can trigger cravings and withdrawals in substance addicts, we can **design our environment** to trigger actions associated with good habits. You are much more likely to drink water if you see more water bottles around your house. You are more likely to go to the gym if you leave your gym bag next to your door. 

**Habit stacking** is an instrumental tool in developing habits and ultimately discipline. As explained, human brains default to routine. Placing a desired habit directly after an already established one is an easy way to build on the pre-established routine - for example, always exercising after you brush your teeth in the morning, or meditating after you brew your morning coffee.

**Implementation intentions** are one I personally use almost daily. If you’re like me you hate to let yourself down. Simply by writing or stating something like “I will [BEHAVIOUR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION], you are scientifically more likely to follow through on the activity. 

#### Join a like-minded community

Surrounding yourself with community members who engage in the same activity you wish to become disciplined in can be very beneficial. You encounter more discussions, group activities, and cultivate new relationships, all of which can act as additional cues to performing the action.

In a similar vein, associating with the wrong community can result in the phenomenon of peer pressure, making it more difficult to resist temptation and succumbing to negative habits.

#### Simplify the habit and take small victories

Too often habits are broken because there is too much **friction** between one’s desire to participate in an activity and difficulty in completing it. When attempting to build habits one should attempt to make completing it as simple as possible - jumping through many hoops before you can even start the activity all but guarantees failure. In the same way, you should only attempt to build a small number of habits at a time. 

James Clear states that each habit should be broken down in steps **no longer than two minutes each**. Instead of attempting to create the habit of running daily, one may first develop the habit of lacing up their shoes and walking out the door. Once that is established, the next step is walking around the block, or running for at least two minutes. Incremental additions to the habit loop follow until the full desired action is entrained. 

I apply this in my daily life by assigning **“full credit”** for just turning up. When it comes to building a fitness habit, I acknowledge walking into the gym and lifting one weight as having the same value as completing a full workout. Playing one note on the piano is just as much a success as playing through an entire sonata. If you can genuinely approach these incremental steps as small victories rather than failures, you will be much more likely to sustain the habit.

#### Never miss twice

This one is simple: **skipping a habit once is expected and acceptable. Skipping it twice is not.** Don’t beat yourself for not being able to complete something one day. But hold yourself to making sure you make at least a small step towards the action the next day. This is the simplest way to prevent a habit from dissolving.

### 2. Approach willpower as an expendable but expandable resource

![1](/images/discipline/4.png)

In social psychology and behavioural neuroscience the current understanding is that willpower is a **finite and depletable resource.** Engaging in a task requiring self-control will lead to lower levels of perseverance for future unrelated tests of willpower, a state known as **‘ego depletion’**. While there is some scientific opposition towards this theory, most laypeople know it holds truth through experience: focusing hard on your study or work earlier in the day does indeed make it harder to resist scrolling endlessly on your phone, or eating that last cookie. 

To preserve the limited pool of willpower to use in more critical times, there are two approaches: **increase your willpower ‘reserve’ or to conserve willpower for use on critical tasks.**

### Increasing your willpower reserve

#### Understand willpower is trainable and generalisable

It is likely that our total pool of willpower can be increased simply through regularly exercising self-control. Oaten and Cheng, two Australian social psychologists, demonstrated that after participants were enrolled in a two-month exercise program, a routine that required exercising willpower, participants performed better in an unrelated test of self-control compared to their results prior to the exercise program. Beyond this, the volunteers also reported eating healthier, spending more frugally, smoking less, and drinking less alcohol. The important implications of this study are that **total willpower reserve is expandable and generalisable to other tasks requiring self-control**.

While this may seem obvious, this scientific research lends support to the idea that **willpower is trainable, just like a muscle**. Every time you resist the temptation to check your phone for notifications, eat unhealthy food, skip the gym to sleep in, you are exercising your self-control and subsequently improving your future ability to exert self-control.

#### Improve your sleep

Sleep is also critically important in increasing our willpower reserve. The brain area that is most associated with regulating self-control is the **prefrontal cortex**. The prefrontal cortex acts to suppress our more primitive instincts and desires, and has been shown to be significantly impaired in function during low sleep states. As a result, one of the most effective ways to boost willpower is to **simply sleep 6.5-8 hours** a night to allow your brain to exert the greatest level of executive control. 

### Expending less willpower throughout the day

#### Reduce opportunities to drain willpower
Under our current conceptualisation of willpower, willpower is used in response to an internal conflict - when you **want** to do something but you **know** you shouldn’t. A simple yet extraordinarily effective tip is simply not to take on too much. You should only be attempting to quit one or two bad habits at once. If it is a deeply ingrained habit such as using your phone when bored, it may exhaust your entire willpower reserve to do so, even for short periods. 

If willpower is our response to internal conflict, a simple way to conserve willpower is to not encounter that conflict in the first place. One can start by minimising **cues** that prompt cravings and temptations. In smokers, removing any paraphernalia related to cigarettes has been proven to reduce total occasions of nicotine craving. If you want to reduce smartphone usage, turn your phone on silent or remove it completely from your sight. 

#### Prioritise important willpower-requiring tasks

As with any finite reserve, efficient resource allocation is a must. One should identify the activities where exerting self-control derives the most benefit, and those that do not provide you much benefit at all. 

For example, when I go on a morning walk I frequently debate with myself whether to buy a coffee from the local cafe or to go home and make one. I must ask myself the question - what do I gain from exerting this self-control? Yes I train my willpower ‘muscle’, but the net benefit is not spending $4. To me living a frugal life is not one of my main priorities. 

This willpower might be better spent motivating me to stay off my phone when writing this article or studying for my next exam. The way I see it, we should be prioritising saving willpower for the events that have a **tangible impact** on reaching important goals, instead of forcing ourselves to withstand any temptation no matter how trivial. One must carefully evaluate their priorities and consider whether certain acts of self-control **actually contribute** significantly to progressing their goals. 

### 3. Beyond the science: my experience of meditation and journaling

Scientists often attempt to operationalise inherently philosophical concepts such as discipline, as I have outlined above, but we are inherently **spiritual and emotional beings** who do not operate on the same logical, discrete realm of science. In my opinion the value of experiential learning **cannot be underestimated**. 

Attempting to implement more discipline in your life, however you conceive that that to be, is the first step. A **continual process of evaluation** through non-judgemental but honest criticism is the much more difficult second step. 

In my life, I’ve been implementing this through **daily journaling**. I aim to write down the successes and failures of my day, particularly when it comes to conducting actions that progress my goals. This not only holds me accountable, but provides clarity in evaluating the factors that lead to positive and negative results, and allows me to plan actions to address them.

#### Criticising without condemnation

As part of this practice, I find myself often being judgemental, providing harsh criticism for failing to complete a habit or acting towards others in a way I am not proud of. I have come to realise that criticising my actions with judicial scrutiny is **not the purpose of journaling**, and my intention has shifted from condemnatory or congratulatory reflection to mindful acknowledgement of both my day’s actions, and the subsequent mental and emotional response I have to them. 

In less wishy-washy terms, I wish to analyse my own emotional reactions to my actions, as these too form a part of ‘me’. Practicing **mindfulness meditation**, a Western application of the **‘Vipassana’** technique of Theravāda tradition, has helped me develop greater metacognitive insight through a continual, non-judgemental awareness of thoughts and the emotions they generate. I will not comment too much on my own practice as I am still a beginner, however I have certainly felt some incremental changes in this skill even from two months of practice.

Cultivating this ability to acknowledge your efforts in maintaining discipline with an uncritical eye allows you to correct disciplinary lapses without unfair judgement. **Just as you would abate your disappointment when addressing the mistakes of your friend, child, or lover, you must extend this compassion towards yourself.** This allows greater clarity when identifying the obstacles and facilitators that can contribute to reaching your goals. This is only one of many benefits that meditation and journaling are purported to offer, many of which I have only read about and not experienced myself. 

I acknowledge that the practices of meditation and journaling have at times garnered a cult-like following, alongside negative associations with exaggerated claims, commercialisation, or a one-size-fits-all mentality. I can only encourage you to approach it with an open mind and a discerning eye, and allow your own experience to guide whether they are compatible with your own journey towards the fulfillment and happiness we all strive for.
