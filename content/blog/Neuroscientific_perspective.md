_The contents of this article were initially part of the article ‘LFMS #2’, however I thought it was too tangential and frankly a little nerdy. I encourage you to read ["that post"](Lesson_2) if you are interested in methods I discovered were useful for studying in my final years of medical school._

### Journey Inside the Brain

**Let’s take a microscopic view of learning.**

In neuroscience, there exists the concept of **‘synaptic plasticity’**. 

We are all born with the same number of neurons, which decline gradually as we age. The connections (known as “synapses”) formed between the **86 billion** neurons form a “neural network”. Given one neuron may synapse with 10,000 other neurons, It is estimated there may be up to **1,000 trillion synapses** that make up the brain.

Memories, knowledge, and wisdom form not from the addition of new neurons, but rather from the evolving network of synapses between them.

Every single interaction we have - every tactile sensation, every conversation, every fleeting thought - prompts a global evolution of this network. Together, they form our consciousness - **a single, ever-changing entity which encapsulates our personality, emotions, and behaviours.**

It’s quite beautiful isn’t it?

### Neuroscience in Learning

Zooming out, this same neural network underlies the way we process information relevant to a certain task. 

Encountering familiar information activates a pre-formed pathway and reinforces it. 

When faced with new information, we attempt to draw upon existing knowledge, and to form new connections with other pathways. Over years of experiences, this creates a sprawling web which allows one to unconsciously navigate the associations between concepts. 

### Evolution of the Medical Mind

In the **first year medical student**, this network is largely unformed. They have never encountered some of this information before

In the **experienced physician**, it is extensive. Their mental network has been refined by the millions of perceptions and interactions they have encountered in the past. 

When faced with a new patient, this network is activated in a way which allows them to instinctively ascertain the most likely diagnosis, and a list of possible differential diagnoses. This is often referred to as a **“constellation”** - a series of signs and symptoms which together are characteristic of a disease entity. 

The **final year graduate** lies somewhere in between. They have encountered the large majority of clinically significant diseases - their epidemiology, presentation, and prognosis.

I believe understanding this progression is key to understanding where the art in medicine lies. The brilliance of doctors is taking an undifferentiated patient, and by considering their demographics, presentation, and investigation results, **understanding how a disease is affecting them as an individual.**

Naturally, if the goal is to become well-rounded doctors (or physicians at least), the focus should be on strengthening the appropriate connections to be able to seamlessly make these Sherlockian deductions. 

Hence one must **repeatedly and consistently expose themselves** to the same conditions in different situations to develop the efficiency of their network representation of medicine. 

**Question banks and spaced repetition** tools may be most time-effective (["see LFMS#2"](Lesson_2)), but nothing can replace the experiential learning of **real-world clinical exposure**.
