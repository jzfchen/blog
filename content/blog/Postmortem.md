The last article on this blog was the one I have spent the most time on so far. It is the most complex, features the most research, analysis, and opinion. Despite this, it is probably the one I am least happy with, when considering the overall direction of this blog. 

From the conception of this article to its publication it has been **one whole Conference Week, one week of break, and a whole month in China**. This has most definitely broken my _"no more than 2 hours on a post"_ rule.  

**One observation - great expectations drive greater procrastination**. This project became somewhat of a brainchild to me. It was the first I actually brainstormed ideas for, researched, drafted, and edited significantly. I'm not necessarily against producing higher quality work, however, I felt I was focusing too much on my vision of the final product that it devalued my initial motivation - to have somewhere where I could freely write and explore my thoughts. 

As a result I would find **literally any opportunity** to not write this article. It actually didn't end up that long or complex at all, but the amount of frustration this thing caused me was **completely disproportionate** to its length. 

It got to the point where I actively **hated** thinking about it let alone writing it. I acknowledge this is **completely irrational** - this is supposed to be a 'passion project' not something to dread. This article ended up feeling like a loose thread I wasn't able to pull, or a ripe pimple I wasn't able to pop.

I finished it out of pure frustration rather than enjoyment (ironic given the subject matter). This may be why the article seems rushed, non-cohesive, or straight-up inaccurate at times.

I understand this is not some profound revelation for any person that has ever attempted to produce anything of a creative nature. The _'writer's block'_ is something I have frequently experienced when making music, when your mind is barren and project untouched. 

However I can acknowledge an element of elegance in this emptiness. In it's own enigmatic way, it is a signal to yourself to take a breath, step back, and recalibrate. To let the ideas come to you when they are ready, to allow the river of creativity flow once more.

The above is not an excuse for my **laziness**. But it is a reminder to myself that my writing style doesn't need to be consistent. I don't have to keep the same tense, or perspective, or mood, or even the same subject matter as a matter of fact. 

I only want to establish a place where I can express myself creatively, intellectually, emotionally, when the time calls for it. When the _vibes are right_, as some may say.

Going forward, I have two main takeaways.

**1. Just write!**

I want to continue to explore interesting subjects without feeling like I have to put out a polished project. The purpose of this blog is to provide something slightly more formal than a diary, but I want to keep in mind that I am writing for myself, not for others. 

**2. I am rescinding my 2-hour-per-post rule**

I don't think creativity should be subject to time limit. If I enjoy writing something I want to continue working on it, and if I don't, I want to just put out at least a shell of an article, even if it isn't finished. Perhaps I will post one of these soon, I can call them blog _'bloopers'_ or _'B-sides'_ or _'blemishes'_ or whatever.

Obviously I haven't kept up with my one post a week deal but I had never concretely committed to that anyway, knowing the busy schedule I had up ahead. 

I hope I can keep writing about things that interest me, I thoroughly enjoyed having an outlet to express some creativity, despite some of the road-bumps I've hit on the way.
