Lessons from Medical School - #1 You’re not that guy

An innate and important tenet of education is progression - from primary school to high-school, high-school to university, university to the workforce. 

Most want to advance in their budding careers, cultivating the marks, experiences, connections needed to make it to that next elusive level. As you ascend each rung of the ladder, you’ll encounter fiercer competition, as the applicants become increasingly competent. 

Heading - the pokemon analogy

I’d like to (very poorly and unnecessarily) analogise this journey to the game Pokemon. 

Starting primary is like choosing your starter Pokemon. You are taught the basics, with your teacher/Professor Oak holding your hand the whole way. 

Next comes high school. You finally step out of Pallet Town, ready to take on everyone and everything in your way! But you have a Level 7 Charmander (Year 7 reading comprehension). And you have a lot of unskippable cutscenes to sit through.

University is like battling the eight gym leaders, each posing successively more difficult challenges. The students (trainers) you meet along the way become stronger too, to the point where you might have to work extra hard just to keep on the path to the Elite Four. 

But most people persevere, and with some determination (and perhaps some Rare Candies to boost attention) finally become a useful member of society (Pokemon Champion? I warned you this analogy was bad).

Heading - Pokemon - Medical School Edition

That was my experience up until my Bachelor’s degree at least. 

Entering medical school was completely different. At every advancement of schooling I had felt somewhat prepared to take on the challenges of the next stage.

In all honesty I thought I would be prepared for medicine too. Could it really be that different?

Our faculty decided that they would shake things up, with our cohort being the first year of the ‘New Program’ (which, in retrospect, could have easily been something straight out of ‘Nineteen Eighty-Four’ or one of Stalin’s campaigns). 

There were good intentions underlying this change; we would have a whole extra year of clinical experience, taking histories, doing examinations, performing procedures! Unfortunately, just like the Monro-Kellie doctrine (sorry), something had to give. 

In this case it meant that the two years we previously had to study all of anatomy, physiology, pathology, pharmacology, microbiology, and the general management of most common ailments was condensed into a measly 10 months. 

So what does medical school have in common with Pokemon, you ask? 

Instead of selecting a spirited Squirtle to start, they had instead given us some pointy sticks and dropped us in front of the Elite Four entrance to fend for ourselves. 

“Don’t worry about learning it all,” they told us, when met with complaints about the excessive workload, “you will cover it again in the next three years.”

To the horde of accustomed star students, many of whom had never failed an exam in their lives, this was not a satisfactory answer. I, for one, had spent most of my undergraduate days attempting to memorise every silly fact that popped up on the lecture slides. 

On top of the coursework, we were expected to attend hospital once a week, to develop a mastery of clinical examination and history taking. This obviously did not happen in a year (or four years, if I’m being honest). 

Being complete newbies in the hospital, everyone is bound to experience some moments that have you cringing late at night years in the future. 

One particularly embarrassing moment for me comes to mind - when I was told that you actually had to rotate the head of the stethoscope around to hear through the other side. I had been listening through the smaller end, nodding my head as if I was hearing something, and then confidently announcing that everything sounded normal. Surely the tutors and other group members knew and were holding in some chuckles…

Looking back, I had no idea what I was doing. To be frank, I was fairly confident no-one else did either, which brought me a tiny bit of relief.

Does this mean that every aspiring medical student is going to have a hard time?

No, of course not! I’m sure there are those in my cohort that have not struggled much at all. But not many of them, I’m guessing…
