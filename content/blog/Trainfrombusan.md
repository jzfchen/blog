_Aboard the 16:51 KTX bullet train bound for Seoul, I have decided to set myself an exercise in reflection. I began to write this post at 5:00PM, and at 5:30PM sharp I will finish it. With no specific topic, muse, motive, expectations, I have set out to write anything that comes to mind._

## Reflection on China
I have recently completed a month-long overseas elective at Ruijin Hospital in Shanghai, spending two weeks with the Haematology team and two weeks with Orthopaedics. The placement was not groundbreaking if I am to be honest. There is only so much motivation and desire to learn you can experience with the knowledge that this is the last placement of the last year of the medical degree. 

What I would like to reflect on is my time living in China. China has really undergone massive changes from the last time I visited. 

I suspect a large reason for this is that this was the first time I have been able to independently experience life in my family's ancestral home. I last visited in 2017 - I can only remember one time where I left the house without my parents (I think my sister and I went to get bubble tea). 

### Connectivity
During my stay this year, what really stood out for me was the sheer level of **connectivity** that China has implemented in every facet of daily life. Literally everything can be bought by scanning a QR code. Shanghai's transport system is excellent - we could rent bikes, ride the metro, hail a DiDi from a single app. I realised much too late in the trip that dining services were even more convenient than I had thought, each chain had its own 'mini-app' that could be accessed from the same central app - we could order food for pick-up while still on the metro, then grab it straight away as we arrived. 

Food is cheap and high-quality in China. Unlike most Chinese restaurants in Western countries, which sell a bit of everything remotely Chinese, Shanghai eateries specialise in a certain type of food, often regional delicacies like Lanzhou noodles or my local doughy favourites - Xiaolongbao and Shengjianbao. 

### People of China
The people are what make China the country it is. You would think a city as large as Shanghai would promote a more individualist way of living, suits hustling to make the next meeting, schoolkids squeezing onto the morning train. This is certainly true to an extent in this modern age, these Western metropolitan ways of living have certainly infiltrated this ever-growing city. China's community charm has not been lost however. Each block is often based around a central alley, in which shopkeepers greet residents on their morning stroll, kids squeal with excitement as they race their bikes, and the elderly congregate to chat late into the evening.

In Chinese culture, family is everything. I had not seen my relatives for 6 years, yet I was embraced with warmth, welcomed into their homes, treated like I had only stepped out of the country one day ago. It is so heartwarming to know that we can reciprocate these feelings of love, togetherness, steadfastness, despite all the time, distance, cultural and linguistic differences that separates us. 

Despite having only spent less than a year in China in total throughout my 24 years, I still feel right at home when I am surrounded by my culture, my history, my people. 

### China and the world
There are many things I could discuss about China, its internal workings, its relationship with the Western world, the flames of Sinophobia that burnt so brightly during the first year of COVID-19. I could discuss the complex identity issues that Australian-born Chinese (ABC) like myself experience as we grow up in a culturally distinct Western country. But I don't want to write about that here. What I want to capture here is my personal feelings towards this trip, my family, and my cultural and spiritual home. 


### Afterword

_Wow! I really enjoyed that. I set myself a time limit and just spilled my bucket of thoughts onto my laptop. I'm surprised I managed to summon some semblance of structure, but that was really not the point. The time limit wasn't really the driving force here, but rather a creative stimulus to force myself to not dwell too much on a single thought (see last post for some details). I'm very glad I was able to write this post and look forward to doing more of these in the future._

_I know myself, however, and know that unlethis sponss I am literally bound to one spot with little to do, I will probably not do this again spontaneously. I will see if this is something I wish to do maybe monthly, or every two months..._
