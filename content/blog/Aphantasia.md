**_For the next minute I want you to close your eyes and imagine a rising sun. Consider carefully the picture that comes before your mind’s eye._**

**_Is the image vivid and clear? Can you distinguish the vibrant hues that envelop the horizon? Does it resemble real life?_**

For some, this mental imagery is an effortless task, a canvas upon which memories and fantasies can be painted. For others, it is impossible, they cannot form a visual image from their imagination. Welcome to the intriguing landscape of **‘phantasia’** - a spectrum which encompasses those with **hyperphantasia**, able to form extremely vivid and realistic mental imagery, and those with **aphantasia**, those who can form none. 

As part of my ongoing fascination with consciousness and philosophy of mind, I could not stop myself from diving into this rabbit hole. This post encapsulates the questions I proposed and answers I found as I delved into this captivating dimension of human cognition.

### How do aphantasics solve spatial problems requiring visualisation?

When I first came across this condition, I was initially skeptical. As someone with a relatively vivid imagination, it did not seem possible that a significant proportion of the population was incapable of forming any mental imagery. 

**_How were they able to solve spatial reasoning puzzles in their head?_**

**_How do they solve geometric tasks in everyday life?_**

**_Would they struggle at school?_**

To demonstrate, I want you to try this problem now. 

>_“Imagine three boxes. The first contains a dog and the second a cat. Then imagine the contents of the first box jumps to the third, the contents of the second box jumps to the first, and finally the third jumps to the second. What is in each box? How do you “see” these movements?”_

For those with ‘normal’ phantasia or hyperphantasia, your natural solution would have been to ‘picture’ the animals jumping to and fro, until they ended up in their final boxes. 

#### But what if you couldn’t use visual imagery?
This problem was proposed to the members of the /r/Aphantasia subreddit, and the replies were a great insight into the condition.

**Most people stored the features of the problems as ‘concepts’ in some mental or tactile form, much like a programmer would assign values to a variable:**

>_“I make a sequence left to right (box 1, box 2, box 3). I assign them new values (7,3,x). Instead of holding “boxes” which might lend themselves to a visual in some, I use number values which are generally more abstract already and more readily distinguishable from each other than “boxes” which imply more uniformity. (I hope that makes sense!) I now reorder the sequence by “holding” the numbers (much like you might hold a phone number momentarily?). I reassign “left”, “center”, “right” as I go to alter the sequence.”_


**Some couldn’t describe their process at all, as encapsulated in my personal favourite response:**

>_“I just kinda move my eyes or something it's weird”_

As I read more and more anecdotes about living with aphantasia, a trend became clear. The inability to form a visual image in the mind did not necessarily hinder aphantasics in completing spatial reasoning tasks. 

While the methods described might seem **cumbersome or illogical** to those who found the problem easy to solve by ‘picturing’ it, it must be remembered that the brain is the ultimate adaptation machine. For someone who has spent **their whole life developing the skills to solve spatial problems without visual imagery**, the solution may come just as quick as those who are able to form these images. 

In fact, research has consistently found that people with **aphantasia have a higher IQ than the general population**, despite most IQ tests featuring spatial reasoning questions. A common thread was that people’s aphantasia was not a barrier to their learning, they simply rely on a more logical step-wise approach to solving tasks that would usually require visualisation. 

Upon further consideration, I have little doubt that lacking the ability to visualise may **strengthen alternate mental faculties** that benefit logical problem solving: working memory, conceptualisation, concentration, and intuition. Maybe part of the reason we find it difficult to solve the above problem without using visual imagination is because we’ve never been required to, and thus the ability to store and manipulate information as such has not developed to a necessary extent. 

#### The scientific perspective
 
In a (slightly) more scientific medium than my perusal of Reddit comments, Adam Zeman, the most notable researcher on aphantasia, found that in aphantasics, successful performance in visual imagery and memory tasks could be dissociated from the subjective experience of visual imagery. 

They utilised variations of this task below, known as mental rotation:

#### Which one of these 3D objects is the same as the one on top? Have a go now and reflect upon how you solved it. 

Non-aphantasics might visualise the object as they rotate it through three-dimensions, trying to match it with one of the four objects. This method is likely primarily dependent on the same visuospatial circuitry you use when you physically rotate an object in the real world. 

The experimenters were surprised to find that aphantasics were able to solve these tasks with a **higher performance than non-aphantasics, a result that does not seem intuitive.**

In alignment with my above proposal, they suggested that **aphantasics may use alternative strategies to achieve high performance in visuospatial tasks**, despite being unable to voluntarily conjure up mental images. Jacobs and colleagues (2018) observe, however, this is often **_“at the cost of metacognitive insight”_**, with participants often stating they could not explain their methods when solving spatial reasoning tasks. 

**_Alisha you can stop the puzzle now if you haven't got it already._**

### How do aphantasics store and access memories?
I want you to close your eyes and relive a memory from the last week. What do you see, smell, feel, and hear?

We may take for granted the complex range of senses that comprise our memories. Aphantasics, however, commonly describe difficulty in forming not only visual imagery, but also smell, taste, and touch (Zeman and colleagues found that 54% of their aphantasic participants report an absence of mental imagery in all sense modalities). Auditory sensation appears to be an outlier, many aphantasics are able to hear certain sounds in their head, someone’s voice or imagine listening to their favourite song. 

So without being able to imagine experiencing these sensations, how do they store and retrieve memories?

Indeed, the current body of literature suggests that aphantasics show **difficulties in recalling details of their past** that would usually be represented via sensory imagery, for example, remembering a parent’s voice, or the details on a friend’s face. Zeman and colleagues (2020) observed that when able to successfully recall a memory, participants demonstrated **decreased emotional engagement** with their autobiographical memories, almost as if they were recalling a historical event.

Dawes and colleagues demonstrated (2020; see Figure) that aphantasics appear to struggle to **project themselves both in past and future scenarios**, indicating that they may experience a greater level of **“presentism”** - an enhanced ability to stay grounded in the present.

It is important to realise that this finding applies to a subset of participants in two particular studies, there is not enough evidence to definitively state that aphantasics have a poorer emotional or mental connection to the past or future. Perhaps more will be revealed when the neurobiological correlates of imagination and episodic memory are further expounded. 


### Do aphantasics lack creativity?

![png](/images/aphantasia/4.png)

Zeman, who first coined the term aphantasia in 2015, stresses that “aphantasia oes not imply a lack of imagination”. In fact, a quick look over the list of notable aphantasics should dispel the notion that aphantasics lack creativity: **Ed Catmull, the founder of Pixar and the former president of Disney, Oliver Sacks, renowned neurologist and author, Penn Jilette, of Penn and Teller, John Green, author of ‘The Fault in Our Stars’ and ‘Paper Towns’.** 

The literature often distinguishes aphantasia as the lack of **mental imagery** rather than **sensory imagination**. Arcangeli (2023) explains that mental imagery is seen as a form of content, something that can be conjured in the mind, while imagination is more of a **‘psychological attitude’**, which may or may not utilise mental imagery, in order to recreate perception. 

**Mark Lawrence**, author of the Broken Empire trilogy, had this to say regarding how aphantasia interacts with his career as a fantasy novellist.

>_“Obviously I don’t have a problem with imagination. On reflection, I reject the description of aphantasia as a defect or a lack. I see it as an alternative. You see a horse if asked to imagine one. I find this rather limiting. I imagine a web of horse-stuff that leads me down many paths. The idea of seeing one particular horse actually lacks appeal. What if it’s not the horse I want? What if I want something larger, more fundamental than an image?_

While this might be **copium**, Lawrence’s insight and profound success in an occupation in which creativity is presumed, if not mandatory, lends great strength to the notion that imagination and mental imagery are distinct. 

### Do aphantasics dream?
While subjects with aphantasia are unable to generate mental imagery while awake, many, if not most, report **experiencing vivid sensory dreams** (Zeman 2020). However, Dawes and colleagues(2020) found that aphantasics reported having dreams with **lower amounts of sensory content and lower awareness of self** compared to controls. The ability to form more clear visual images while unconscious when compared to conscious, suggests to me one of two things regarding the ontological status of dreams. 

My first hypothesis would be that **dreaming and mental imagery recruit distinct sets of neural circuitry**. Dreaming may be more akin to the ‘sensory imagination’ described in the previous paragraph.

My second hypothesis is that while tapping into the same neural pathways, aphantasics possess the ability to **unconsciously form and manipulate mental imagery**. This may explain Dawes’ (2020) findings of reduced vividness of dreams, and preserved performance in visuospatial tasks that would logically necessitate some form of mental imagery. It could be that some aphantasics are simply unaware of performing these tasks via a visualisation-based method, contributing to the lack of metacognitive insight that is often reported. 

### Are aphantasics protected from PTSD?
It is clear that there is a strong influence of visual imagery in certain mental health disorders such as schizophrenia, PTSD, and specific phobias. For PTSD in particular, vivid memory intrusions, often visual in nature, are thought to trigger an **individual’s appraisal of a previous trauma as a current threat**, contributing to significant distress.

It is reasonable to assume that the **absence or decreased vividness of mental imagery might partially protect aphantasic individuals** from experiencing symptoms of PTSD.

![5.png](/images/aphantasia/5.png)

Dawes and colleagues (2020) found that self-reported scores of trauma-related symptomatology (Intrusions, Avoidance, Negative cognition and mood, and Arousal and Reactivity) in aphantasics were **not significantly different from controls**. This may lend further support to the hypotheses that the ability to consciously visualise objects and scenes may be **functionally distinct** to the involuntary sensory images experienced in trauma-related intrusions and dreams. 

It is clear further research, both of the neurobiological and philosophical nature, is required to elucidate the true nature of what invariably appears to be a normal variant of human cognition.
