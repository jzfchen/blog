Picture a medical student studying. What comes to mind?

Do you envision brainiacs hunched over textbooks during all-nighters, furiously highlighting away at everything that sounds vaguely useful?

Or perhaps a student poring over their meticulously hand-drawn, anatomically-accurate diagram of the left third toe?

You might be surprised to learn that despite medicine’s reputation as one of the most content-heavy disciplines, its students seldom rely on the aforementioned methods to grasp its intricacies. 

Of course, there are a number of medics who utilise these labour-intensive techniques, particularly when starting their first year. 

Survey the same group of students in their final year, and you will find that most of them have moved on to more efficient methods. 

### Why Be Inefficient?

So if these strategies are so time-consuming with minimal benefit in medicine, why do people use them?

I can provide some insight on this because _I was one of these students_.

The reality is that these methods are used because they are tried-and-tested against all levels of their previous schooling, in which analytical reasoning and deduction are largely superseded by **rote memorisation**.

Take English, for example. It is a subject that weaves together the intricate threads of language, literature, and communication. It boasts an infinite breadth of creative expression, and exemplifies beauty in subjectivity. 

My approach to my final English exams?

I would borrow thematic ideas from previous graduates, memorise my essays word-for-word, and regurgitate them in the final exam, with a few changes here and there.

Undergraduate examinations were much the same. 

For most courses, teaching is delivered in the form of one-hour presentations, usually in the form of PowerPoint slides. Assessable content is what is written on the slides.

So the student who reads broadly and actively participates in tutorials may be outperformed on a question by the student who happened to read the relevant slide **5 minutes before the exam**. 

> For these subjects, there is simply very little incentive to study beyond the limited breadth of the syllabus.

### What makes medicine different? 

Contrary to popular belief, **you do not need to be "smart" to study medicine**. While it is undoubtedly true that (most) medical students are intelligent and hard-working, I see this more as a product of the stringent entry requirements imposed by universities. 

It takes a unique combination of **brains and unrelenting stubbornness** to navigate the seemingly endless examinations and interviews to enter the program. 

In fact, my experience is that the most brilliant students often have loftier ambitions (i.e. The Big Tech world). As one of my senior doctors once remarked about his junior colleagues:

>“Smart enough to get in, dumb enough to stay”

### Too much, too fast, too irrelevant

There is not a particularly high level of insight required to study the craft, but simply an overwhelming barrage of information. 

In our first year we covered more content than in all three years of my undergraduate education. We would have **25+ hours** of in-person lectures each week, followed by **15 hours** of poorly recorded online videos. 

Take microbiology, for example. I remember being delivered an **180 slide** powerpoint in 1 hour, each one chock-full of organism names, microscopy findings, antibiotic classes and mechanisms. This lecture was the university absolving themselves of any responsibility and saying _“we’ve taught it all, it's all on the slides”_.

_You quickly realise that the word "Important" is very subjective in medicine_

This was no different to handing a textbook to each student and sending them on their way (not that they would ever pay for our academic resources). 

Of course, it is then up to the students to **actually** memorise, process, and apply this knowledge in a real-world setting.

To add insult to injury, there is an unspoken expectation that students study beyond the scope of the structured teaching, as if we would have time to pore over textbooks and the latest medical journals after a 12 hour day of class. 

In fact, approaching the final years of the degree, the delivered lectures are **painfully inadequate**. It is well-understood that relying on the university-provided material alone would mean that you **failed all of final examinations** (and by a significant margin).

It is no surprise then, that anyone attempting to simply learn the content of the lectures by rote memorisation was in for a rude awakening when they opened their first test paper. 

## The Changing Mind in Medicine

![6](/images/lesson2/6.png)

Becoming a high-performing medical student is not about being a walking encyclopaedia - simply remembering all the obscure anatomical variants and medication interactions is not sufficient nor efficient.

Instead, every final year student will realise that they have undergone a fundamental overhaul in the way that they process medical information - a change that has occurred gradually and silently through their studies and clinical placements.

To have a strong knowledge base is the **bare minimum** and a small task for these bright graduates. 

It is rather how **efficiently** that this information is stored, and the **strength and diversity of the connections** between different pools of knowledge that dictate how one will perform.

I had initially written a section on the neural basis of how we learn and process new information, and the implications of this on optimal study methods, but this was too tangential to the spirit of this article. If you want to read this, see the post - ["The Neuroscientific Perspective on Learning"](Neuroscientific_perspective).

## Studying Efficiently - The Methods

So performing well in a content-heavy course requires the strengthening of associations in some intangible conceptual framework. 

That’s all very nice, but what does this mean in practice?

### Spaced Repetition

One of the most robust and reproducible methods in the optimisation of learning is with repeated encounters with material, spaced out in time (as opposed to back-to-back). Aptly named **‘spaced repetition’**, this technique has been a tried-and-tested favourite of medical students for countless years. 

There is a sizable body of evidence to suggest the efficacy of spaced repetition in long-term retention. One early study in 1925 had students recite the Athenian Oath. One group of students heard the oath read 6 times in a row. Another group of students heard the oath 3 times on 1 day, 3 more times 3 days later. 

Both groups of students had heard the oath a total of 6 times, however one group had a three day break in the middle. 

When asked to recite the oath 4 weeks later, the spaced group **significantly outperformed the massed group** - one of the many studies that have demonstrated durable long-term retention effects. 

It is inconclusive whether there is an optimal _‘spacing lag’_ - whether there is an optimal delay between reviews to maximise retention intervals. This appears to be dependent on the nature of the content, and desired length of retention (with longer retention intervals requiring longer spacing intervals). 

#### How do you apply spaced repetition?

**Anki** - a flashcard-based mobile and desktop application. 

Anki use is extremely prevalent amongst medical students; I would estimate that **50-90%** of students in my cohort have used Anki to study for their examinations at some point (sounds like I’m describing a drug). 

The premise is simple. You create cards that test your recall of a single concept, or use a pre-made deck. Every day, you review a certain number of new or old cards. 

![2](/images/lesson2/2.png)

If you get the question correct - press **‘Good’** - the card is placed in your ‘Review’ queue, and will come back up tomorrow. 

If you get the question wrong - press **‘Again’** - the card will be reviewed again in 15 minutes. 

Anki automates the process of spacing so that concepts that you find easy (and thus lower yield) are reviewed less frequently. If you consistently get a card wrong, you will be asked to recall it more frequently. 

In my experience, this has four main benefits. 

1. **It saves time and keeps you accountable.** You can reap the benefits of the technique without having to painstakingly schedule reviews in some master diary. 
2. **It keeps you accountable and makes studying a habit.** Perhaps the most important benefit - Every day a red number shows up telling you how many cards you have to review - it becomes cathartic to watch it gradually dwindle. Doing your daily Ankis becomes somewhat of a (begrudging) ritual after a few weeks. 
3. **It distils concepts down to the most relevant facts.** This is dependent on the quality of your cards and requires an understanding of what content is actually important when writing/selecting them. 
4. **It is convenient to use.** I’ve often whipped out my phone to smash out some cards when waiting for the bus. This wouldn’t be possible with pen and paper, or even laptop notes.

### Multiple Choice Question Banks

I am a **staunch advocate** for the use of multiple choice questions in the enhancement of learning for medical students. 

In cognitive psychology there has been a long-standing assumption, particularly in study design, that the learning occurs when exposed to material during study (e.g. reading textbooks), and that testing represents a **neutral event** designed to assess the retention of such information.

It is now understood that **testing itself leads to learning** via a reconceptualisation of methods of retrieval and thus modifying the way memories are stored. 

Here is my evidence-based perspective, along with my personal experience, on why I believe MCQs are one of the most effective methods for enhancing medical education.

### 1. Study the way you will be assessed. 

If you want to run faster, **you run more**. 

If you want to jump higher, **you jump more**. 

If you want to perform better in multiple choice tests you … watch lectures and read textbooks?

Irrespective of the cognitive benefits of testing, there are intangible aspects of **examination technique** such as time management, recognising key words and distractors, and using process of elimination that must be learnt to optimise performance.

This can only be achieved with **repeated practice** - just like anything in life, you will gain an unconscious advantage in multiple choice examinations just by doing them.

### 2. MCQs train your personal Medical ChatGPT via higher-order cognitive tasks

As previously discussed, the depth of a student’s understanding is encoded in the **efficiency** of memory storage, and the **strength of the connections** between relevant areas.

The simplicity of design of the MCQ does not encapsulate its potential to assess higher order domains required of clinicians such as problem solving and generalisation.

![3](/images/lesson2/3.png)

For senior medical students, the most common type of MCQ (see above) has a stem which consists of a presenting complaint and examination findings. They are then asked to either diagnose the patient, or suggest the most appropriate investigation or management option. 

To complete such a task requires active synthesis of provided information, recall of relevant facts and association, and critical thinking regarding the likelihood of several options. 

This task is actually quite similar to what will be expected of future clinicians. 

Of course, in the real-world setting, patients will not have all their history, examination findings, and investigations nicely written out for you to read over like in MCQ world.

I believe that each time you complete one of these questions, the high level of cognitive demand leads to a gradual **remodelling of neural connections** between concepts - one symptom is associated with this disease, this sign is not present in this condition, this test result is a red flag and requires a specific treatment.

This is like your personal **Medical ChatGPT**, an artificial intelligence (or should I say organic intelligence) designed to interpret and answer medical questions based on all the experiences it has been trained with.

Before you know it, your medical neural network (see ‘Neuroscientific Perspective’ article for interest) has been trained to high efficiency. When you read a stem, you see only the relevant distinguishing information and can form a differential list within seconds. 

This is what I believe the **true strength of repeated MCQ testing** is - one that surely correlates with diagnostic and therapeutic efficiency as a future doctor.

#### Talent in Medicine

As an aside - this is where I believe the _“talent”_ in being a physician lies. Individuals who are able to most efficiently train their internal model of medicine to tackle diagnostic dilemmas with minimal exposure. This idea has been conceptualised as one of the many facets of what is conventionally defined as “intelligence”. 

The reality is however, **this “talent” is useless** without heavy exposure to relevant factual knowledge, clinical cases, and assessment - simply that it allows them to refine their ChatGPT faster than others. 

With time and experience, all medical students, most of whom possess above average problem solving and critical thinking skills, will develop their own sharp clinical acumen. What distinguishes doctors who have reached that stage, will be their interpersonal skills and traits: **empathy, communication, and integrity.**

### 3. Feedback enhances benefits of testing
One final but important factor in MCQ testing is the provision of **feedback**. Testing alone has been demonstrated to improve retention in the absence of feedback, but it is well-established that feedback further enhances its efficacy. 

The MCQ banks that I have used provided relevant and detailed feedback messages after completing a question.

I believe this is an extremely efficient method of learning, in a short amount of time you are able to debate, using your existing knowledge, the validity of two or more options, followed by a confirmation or correction of your choice. Furthermore, you are provided additional information that will aid your distinction on these options in the future.

This is like **liquid gold** for our medical neural network, providing invaluable data for the training of the unconscious decision making model. 

## Conclusion

So there you have it, my manifesto on simple methods for optimising learning in medical school. 

You might ask: _Aren’t your views heavily affected by confirmation bias/personal bias?_

**Almost certainly.**

Everyone has a method that works best for them. Perhaps there are those who really learn better by setting up a 5 hour timelapse of them drawing and highlighting furiously. 

I can only speak from my experience, and my limited understanding of the literature I have studied. I encourage all past, current, and future students to engage in a constant re-evaluation and refinement of their study methods - the more efficient you become, the more you can relax!
