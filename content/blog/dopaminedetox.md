Sweeping across social media is the trend of the ‘dopamine detox’ - identifying behaviours that we default to for a quick boost in dopamine, sometimes referred to as the ‘reward’ neurotransmitter. This ranges from the most obvious distractions, being imprisoned in an endless Instagram Reel session or binging four seasons of Mr Robot in a week (couldn’t be me), to the more subtle ones, such as glancing at your phone every time it lights up with a notification, or checking your email every 10 minutes out of anticipation. 

As with everything social media, I believe both the methods required and the benefits proclaimed from fasting from these dopamine hits have been grossly misrepresented. The most common method I have encountered is the ‘24-hour dopamine detox’, in which a social media-addicted girlie announces bravely on her page that she will be refraining from any mentally-stimulating activity for one full day. Of course, this is meticulously documented on her iPhone camera, demonstrating her slow descent into madness, and followed up with a 10 minute monologue on how she had somehow attained enlightenment in her act of martyrdom. 

I saw one ridiculous timelapse of a boy staring at a clock for 24 hours straight in an attempt to cure himself of this affliction, which cannot be healthy for the mind or body (in my humble professional medical opinion).

In this post I hope to provide a balanced take on the effects of digital distraction, explore the subtle behaviours and habits that have led to our dependence on technology, and methods I believe can provide a sustainable ‘detoxification’ from these high-stimulus, low-value activities.

## Dopamine and the habit loop - an optional read

I have briefly discussed the neurochemistry of dopamine and what it represents to us as a species in the ‘MUSIC AND NEUROSCIENCE article’. 

**Feel free to skip ahead if you don’t want to read my nerd rant (seems to be a common trend).**

For a much better researched and much much more eloquent take on the same topic I would highly recommend James Clear’s _‘Atomic Habits’_ and Charles Duhigg’s _‘The Power of Habit’_. 

Dopamine is a neurotransmitter far more complex than can be done justice by simply labeling it the ‘pleasure’ or ‘reward’ chemical (something which I have literally done in the introduction). 

While its dysregulation is implicated heavily in several debilitating addictions and medical conditions - Parkinson’s disease, gambling, alcohol and drug addiction, porn addiction - it is not something that should inherently be feared. Dopamine plays a crucial role in motivating humans to pursue biologically relevant rewards: food, sex, companionship, status, money - ensuring the propagation of our species. It is also the cornerstone of habit formation, both good and bad.

A habit can be broken simply into four components: **Cue, Craving, Action, Reward**. 

**An example of a habit loop:**

**Cue:** You are stressed and hungry at work

**Craving:** You want to distract yourself and eat

**Action:** You pull out a bag of chips and snack on them

**Reward:** Your hunger is relieved. The salt and fat in the chips induces physical satisfaction and a large amount of dopamine release, enforcing the habit of snacking at work, even when you are not hungry. 

Every time these events occur together, they reinforce the association between the cue and the reward, until even encountering the cue itself is enough to induce dopamine release. This accounts for the feeling we know as ‘anticipation’, further driving the craving and motivation. 

## A probabilistic explanation of smartphone addiction

**Here’s my theory:** the intensity of our craving and motivation for a certain reward, and thus our likelihood to complete the routine which grants it, is determined by the interplay between the quantity of dopamine released by the reward, and the effort required to complete the routine. 

This can be represented with the following formula which I will humbly and graciously name JZFC's Law:

> #### Reward from satisfying craving X Ease of Task = Likelihood of completing task 



Some tasks are intensely rewarding but very difficult to complete - graduating from university or raising a child. 

Some tasks are easy to complete but offer little dopamine reward - picking up some rubbish (unless you’re a clean freak) or folding your laundry

Both of these categories represent tasks that are more difficult to form habits of doing, the net amount of dopamine release is going to be low either way. 

Drugs like methamphetamine release an incredible amount of dopamine, many times greater than anything humans would otherwise encounter in life. Despite the relative difficulty in purchasing and using the drug, addiction is almost inevitable with repeated use. 

The problem with our digital era is that every device, app, notification, is specifically designed to captivate your attention and induce moderate dopamine release for very little effort. Scrolling TikTok satisfies your craving for mental stimulation when you are bored. Liking a photo on Instagram activates the same neural circuits for social bonding, with much less energy expended. 

It is not surprising that almost everyone with access to a smart device has become essentially ‘addicted’ - the level of stimulation and reward is disproportionate to the ease of access.

## Is it really that bad to be addicted to technology?

I will explore some of the negative effects of dopamine overstimulation and possible benefits with reducing overreliance on short bursts of digital stimulation and let you decide for yourself. 

I think the problem really isn’t with dopamine release itself. Sure, too much release of dopamine can over time lead to receptor downregulation, theoretically leading to a lower baseline level of ‘happiness’ and seeking greater ‘hits’. But this is not really the case, changes in mood and experience of pleasure is more regulated by the changes in dopamine levels rather than the resting baseline. 

The main problem, in my opinion, is that succumbing to constant digital distraction has effects on attention and cognition that hinder our ability to achieve our goals productively. 

**To illustrate my point I will briefly summarise the literature (I promise I won’t make it too boring…)**

**Sleep break here**

1. Attention is a finite resource and scattered attention leads to poorer cognitive performance

2. Smartphone use during a demanding cognitive task significantly disrupts attention
3. Greater social media use outside of cognitively-demanding tasks predicts greater difficulty and poorer attention during productive tasks

These three points alone are enough to suggest that digital addiction predicts poorer attention during important tasks, impairing your productivity and overall success. 

In a psychological and biological sense, stopping yourself from obtaining a dopamine hit every time you are bored represents a retraining of this entrenched habit, until you no longer associate smartphone usage as a method to alleviate your boredom. 

In a more philosophical and metacognitive sense, I’d like to refer to the concept of ‘digital willpower’, the ability to resist the urge to occupy your boredom by checking your messages, listening to a podcast, or watching a video. This willpower is like a muscle, one that is exercised every time you are able to restrict yourself, and one that will be available when you really need to focus. Truly achieving a state of ‘Deep Work’ (coined in the book of the same title by author Cal Newport - another highly recommended read), free from distraction, presents a stronger sense of fulfilment that cannot be easily replicated. 

I believe a constant need for distraction also takes away from the practice of meditative mindfulness, a practice that alone can reduce stress, uncertainty, and negative emotions. However, I will save this (perhaps) for a future post.

With both rationalisations the importance of weaning yourself off reliance on digital distractions becomes apparent. 

## My own smartphone addiction

I realised recently how strongly my phone had taken over my life; here’s a brief outline of how digital distractions intruded in my day. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### My day:
Wake up - stay in bed and scroll messages, news, check fantasy basketball, watch Youtube videos until hungry.

Meal time - scroll my phone, watch a video

Walking between destinations - scrolling phone or listening to music or podcast
Fleeting moments of boredom - phone out, mindlessly open Reddit or Messenger or Fantasy

Shower time - put on music or podcast to listen to

Sleep time - fall asleep with video or podcast

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reflecting on this is quite embarrassing. I realised that I would fill almost every waking minute with some form of smartphone use. I considered myself a good multi-tasker, I would have on a YouTube video while playing a game, or even played games during my online tutoring sessions. 

Every vibration of my phone would be met with an instant craving to check it, even though it was likely a spam email or useless Tweet. 

I don’t think I’ve fundamentally altered my relationship with technology just yet, I’m sure I will find myself slipping into bad habits eventually.

But by acknowledging my problem and implementing a few intentional decisions, I think I have made a significant impact on how I spend my spare time, and my ability to focus when I need it. 

## Realistic next steps 

In this section I will share my personal experience in implementing some small changes in my life to address my smartphone addiction. They are a collection of tips from books on the topic, the scientific literature, and my personal thoughts on the topic. I don’t think this will necessarily work for everyone, nor am I claiming this is the best way to do it. But for me this has been a more realistic approach to detaching myself from unnecessary technology use. 

### Step 1: Identify and evaluate problematic smartphone use

This is probably the most important step. With the understanding of how it could negatively affect my life, I had to be realistic and brutal to myself in identifying all the instances of smartphone and computer use in my life that was not beneficial. 

This started off by literally mentally noting every time I picked up my phone, which apps I opened, and whether it was actually for a purpose or I was just bored. This included glancing at my phone when a Messenger notification came up, and considering whether or not I actually needed to reply to that message. I realised most notifications are not time-sensitive at all, and thus not worth interrupting your attention for in the first place. 

From the people I’ve spoken to, checking your phone or listening to something while walking or doing chores has become a habit too. It’s not inherently wrong to satisfy boredom, however I believe being able to overcome that urge and just focusing purely on the task has spillover effects on your personal and work life. 

I asked myself the question: Do I really need to listen/watch/open my phone right now? And the answer was almost always no. 

### Step 2: Embrace boredom (slowly)

I don’t think the cold turkey approach that many advocate for is realistic nor effective long-term. One day of no technology use is just going to make you rebound and rely even more heavily on it. 

The problem isn’t with mental stimulation, which is inherently a good thing, it is that overreliance corrupts your ability to dedicate attention to meaningful tasks. 

I am not suggesting you remove all technology use which is frankly stupid. Digital entertainment is both appropriate and suggested - you have the right to stay happy. 

I think looking critically at the moments you have identified in the previous step and deciding to gradually embrace the periods of boredom is a great idea. For the next week, pick one or two walks from the train station, or drives to work that you don’t listen to a podcast or use your phone. Don’t scroll your phone for one meal a day. 

These small sustainable wins are the cornerstone of any effective habit development, and they actually make you feel good! I personally visualise every time I consider reaching for my phone but decide against it, as one ‘rep’ for exercising my mental willpower, knowing it will get easier every time I do it.

If you are familiar with the practice of mindfulness I would highly recommend trying to just allow yourself to 'exist' as an alternative to using your phone. The goal isn't to be the Dalai Lama, with nothing but thoughts of inner peace. It's ok to acknowledge you are bored. It is a practice with benefits extending far beyond productivity.    

More importantly don’t beat yourself up for not adhering to this 'digital detox'. If you want to make sustainable change it has to be intentional but realistic. Staying up late at night watching YouTube six out of seven days doesn’t make you a failure as long as that one night you chose to sleep early (this is very much directed at myself).

Having it in your mind is already a lot of the change. 

### Step 3: Remove distractions

This step should be completed simultaneously with Step 2. A huge part of a habit is the cue - what prompts you to begin craving the reward in the first place. If you want to correct a behaviour, you are doing yourself a huge favour by removing this cue.

Start by removing problematic apps or devices from your immediate sight. If you find yourself defaulting to opening Instagram when you pick up your phone, delete it from your home screen. If you find yourself reaching for your phone during a focused work session, put it in your bag.

Use the Do Not Disturb mode on your phone more. I have it on essentially all the time now. 

Permit very time-sensitive notifications, e.g. Email if you are at work, messages or calls from your parents or partner, but I quickly realised you really don’t need to be getting most notifications. Every time I get a distracting notification like “X posted for the first time in a while”, I open the app and turn all useless notifications off immediately. 

Once I realised my daily function is really not that dependent on many time-sensitive notifications I felt much more free in disabling them. 

### Step 4: Practise working deeply

To reap the rewards of your new found concentration (not really), I would highly recommend utilising ‘Deep Work’ sessions (again go read Cal Newport’s book). 

Basically just set aside some time (the author recommends 90 minutes) where you will focus intently on what you are doing. You can apply this to work (although it may be unreasonable in jobs where you have to constantly attend messages/emails), reading, writing, or anything you think you could benefit from more attention in. 

Get rid of your phone. The more you practise working without distractions, the more profound the depth of your focus and productivity, and the more rich the satisfaction from completing the session. This is especially important for ‘knowledge workers’, those who ‘think for a living’.

In all honesty, I really struggled with this to start but it has gotten easier as I resolved to remove more and more distractions from my daily life, not just when working. 

In fact, I spent 3 hours deep in thought this morning writing this article from start to finish with no interruptions! Something that I am proud of and certainly not always replicable.

## Conclusion

I realise not everyone has the desire to drastically alter their work or personal habits. I realise this may come off as preachy even though noone reads my blog. 

However, I believe there is value in practising attention and focus in our daily lives, and I hope my personal experience has provided you some food for thought no matter your stance.
