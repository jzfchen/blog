In science, we refer to something as a “Problem” if we lack a conceptual understanding or model of some empirically observed phenomenon. The “Binding Problem” is one example which continues to suspend members of this community in an ontological stasis.

### What is the Binding Problem?

In our lives, we are constantly flooded with perceptual stimuli from all of our senses: colours, shapes, movement, sounds, textures, smells. In our current model of perception, we encode sensations via highly specialised receptors which activate their connected nerve fibres (neurons) when exposed to the specific stimulus they are tuned for. For example, when each of the rods and cones of our retina are exposed to particular wavelengths of light, electrical impulses propagate from neuron to neuron, from eye to brain, until the signal makes its way to the Primary Visual Cortex at the back of the neocortex. 

To encode even a single flash of light, there is an immensely complex set of electrical patterns, network communications, encoding and decoding of information that ultimately results in the sense we call ‘vision’. This entity is known as a neural circuit. 

Every possible sensation you can experience is encoded in a functionally and anatomically distinct neural circuit, with its own highly specialised nerve endings, network of neurons, and separate brain areas for processing. 

Yet if you allow yourself time to observe your surroundings, taking intentional note of all the sensations in the present, it is clear we are not experiencing each one of these senses in a piecewise manner. It is not as if we have allocated separate mental faculties towards experiencing vision, tactile sensation, hearing, like a security guard behind a set of perceptual monitors. 

In our consciousness, there is a unification of experience which allows us to simply ‘exist’ in the present, with each of our senses contributing seamlessly towards the ‘one percept’. 

The unresolved question thus remains: How do the distinct neural circuitry processing perceptual objects intertwine  to form a single, unified, phenomenal percept? 

While the neural substrates for this unifying mechanism have not been revealed, its existence is inferred; our lived experience being the evidence. 

This in essence is the ‘Binding Problem’, or more specifically, the ‘Consciousness Binding Problem’. 

### A word on Philosophy of Mind and Dualism

In his _Monadology_ (1714), Leibniz outlined his views on the failure of materialism to explain the unification of percept and consciousness:

_One is obliged to admit that perception and what depends upon it is inexplicable on mechanical principles, that is, by figures and motions. In imagining that there is a machine whose construction would enable it to think, to sense, and to have perception, one could conceive it enlarged while retaining the same proportions, so that one could enter into it, just like into a windmill. Supposing this, one should, when visiting within it, find only parts pushing one another, and never anything by which to explain a perception. Thus it is in the simple substance, and not in the composite or in the machine, that one must look for perception._

Leibniz argues that no matter the complexity of a hypothetical machine, its inner workings, and the electrical circuitry, it reveals no explanation of the perception of a singular consciousness, suggesting that ‘there is a true unity which corresponds to what is called the I in us; such a thing could not occur in artificial machines, nor in the simple mass of matter, however organized it may be.’. 

As someone who has been deeply rooted in the scientific world, and one who is armed with the accumulated products of the last 300 years of research into the neural substrates of consciousness, I find myself disagreeing with the notion that the absence of a clear understanding of mechanism unifying percept denounces the possibility of its material existence, and thus implies the existence of a metaphysical ‘soul’, or higher consciousness.

Descartes proposed the idea of a central ‘soul’, ontologically separate from physiological function, as the main governor of consciousness. We now reject this theory; many phenomena previously thought to only be able to be explained by some ethereal separation of Mind and Body, e.g. hallucinations, psychosis, near-death experiences, dreams, have since been explained purely in terms of electrical and chemical interactions within the brain. 

That is, just because we do not understand how the individual neural circuitry of perception contributes to the overall consciousness, does not necessitate the existence of a higher ‘binding’ power, or the separation of Mind and Body, the fundamental basis of dualism. 

That being said, modern Dualists do not deny that consciousness is inextricably linked to brain activity, yet argue that it cannot be totally explained by brain activity. I find myself falling into this camp for now. I cannot say I am completely convinced by the possibility that the concept of Mind is fallacious, and all consciousness and its associated phenomena can be purely explained in terms of neural connectivity. 

### fMRI and the neural substrates of consciousness and binding

With the end of the 20th century came a surge in functional neuroimaging, drastically improving the ability to visualise the function of the brain as it underwent cognitive tasks. Seiji Ogawa’s discovery of the ‘blood oxygen level-dependent’ (BOLD) effect was pivotal in this. Ogawa demonstrated that metabolic perturbations, specifically in blood oxygenation, was correlated with the intensity of neural activity. In simple terms, blood and oxygen are directed to the specific areas of the brain firing during a mental task. This discovery eventually led to the invention of functional magnetic resonance imagery (fMRI), combining the ability to generate high-resolution 3D images of live subjects, and mapping on it the areas with maximal neural activity.

Using this technology, numerous studies have attempted to identify the brain regions responsible for combining individual senses. Stoll and colleagues implemented a visual task in which four objects oscillated first with no discernible pattern, causing participants to encode each object locally. With the second percept, the objects appeared to move following the sides of a diamond, encouraging participants to encode the objects as part of a global percept.

The main finding was that a global encoding appeared to suppress the ‘lower-order’ visual cortex, involved in encoding basic movements and shape borders, and instead recruited ‘higher-order’ cortex which is more associated with assigning meaning and biological relevance to objects. This was not a particularly ground-breaking discovery, however demonstrated the involvement of higher-cortical areas in the unification of percept. 

In a similar experiment, Grassi and colleagues also demonstrated lower-order cortical suppression and posterior parietal cortex activation during global perception. Unfortunately, the extent of these fMRI studies have largely been limited to the studies of visual perception. While difficult, perhaps further experiments can attempt to functionally image subject’s brains during a task requiring unified perception of multiple senses, compared to when viewing each sense alone.

### Could subjective unity of perception be an illusion?

In 1965, renowned philosopher Hubert Dreyfus proclaimed that a computer would never beat a human in chess because a machine could never capture the intuition of human intelligence. 

Daniel Dennett, another notable philosopher and cognitive neuroscientist, disagreed. Two years later, Dreyfus found himself on the losing end of a chess match against _Mac Hack_ the first chess computer program playing in a human tournament. Another thirty years later, the IBM computer _Deep Blue_ famously defeated the world chess champion Garry Kasparov.

The answer was clear. Chess computers either possessed intuition, or didn’t require intuition to beat humans.

Daniel Dennett had always held the position that the mind was nothing special, that there was no separation of Mind and Body as Descartes and Leibniz had claimed so many years ago. 

His views on the unification of perception adhere to the same theme. He proposes that our perception of having one unified experience despite having distinct perceptual apparatus is an illusion. He believes that what we experience as ‘consciousness’ is actually a series of ‘drafts’ based on individual perceptions, which only appear to be unified.

This theory is perhaps most in alignment with the purely physiological view of the Binding Problem. That is, all these sensations and perceptions are actually distinct, and we only think that we are viewing them as single, synchronous events, removing the idea of ‘consciousness’ from the equation. 

Moutoussis and Zeki (1997) provided further evidence towards this idea by demonstrating that while we may perceive two perceptual stimuli as occurring simultaneously, colour is perceived before orientation and motion by a significant interval. For example, if you are shown a red box moving downwards, and in a brief time span, it switches directions, and then after 40ms changes colour. You would see the box changing direction and colour at the same time, demonstrating that what we consider to be a temporally synchronous event does not represent reality, and thus suggesting our consciousness is a piecewise construction of reality rather than a true representation. 

I myself subscribe to a more network-based theory, in which there is not multiple ‘drafts’ but instead a complex network of neural connections between brain areas responsible for different modalities of perception. I believe that this network does indeed generate a single ‘copy’ of perception that is informed simultaneously by the corresponding brain areas, but agree with Moutoussis and Zeki’s observations that they may not constitute true temporal synchrony. 

To be honest, the research surrounding network theories of consciousness is both too vast and complicated to understand for me currently, and I will have to do some more reading before doing it justice. 

### Conclusion

I hope this article has perhaps piqued your interest on a fascinating and developing facet of cognitive neuroscience (in my opinion at least). While the overall non-conclusiveness of both the philosophical and experimental approaches may seem somewhat unfulfilling and disappointing, or even boring, it serves to me as a reminder of the reality of early research in a budding field. 

Perhaps one day we will know all about what binds our senses together into one perception, or at least creates the illusion of unity. Maybe one day I will even contribute a paper in the field. We shall see.
