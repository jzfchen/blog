There is no doubt that we as a species have some innate attraction to music.

The entanglement of man and music predates written history, and is pervasive in near all documented cultures. The first known musical instruments 

Music has an undeniable ability to unite its listeners and performers. Church choirs belt out gospel hymns, metalheads get drowned in a sea of moshers, Swiftie superfans sway in unison to an encore of “Love Story”. 

In modern times, music is found in many facets of our lives.

Every brand has its jingle, every TV show has its theme song, every movie has its soundtrack. 

## Why have we evolved to enjoy music?

There are numerous fascinating theories regarding the evolutionary origins of music appreciation, given that it does not seemingly provide any biological survival or reproductive advantage.

One such theory suggests that the development of a sense of rhythm stems from the evolutionary switch to bipedalism - walking on two legs. Human locomotion produces a more predictable “beat” compared to quadrupedalism . When moving with two or more individuals, a sense of this “beat” could allow humans to synchronise their movements, thus generating periods of relative silence in which they could better detect prey or predators. 

Other researchers, including the Charles Darwin himself, have postulated that it is an evolutionary relic of primate sexual selection, promotes social cohesion, and promotes mother-infant attachment. 

## Music and Dopamine

Regardless of the origins of human music appreciation, there seems to be some universal consensus on what types of sounds are “pleasurable”. 

A pure sine wave tone will be preferred to white noise, and a major chord will be preferred to playing 4 keys randomly on the keyboard. Certain successions of chords - known as chord progressions - will elicit more intense positive responses than others, and in combination with beats, instrument choice, and vocals, may create an state of emotional and physiological arousal not dissimilar to winning big at the poker table or eating your favourite food.

There is a neurobiological explanation for this similarity: Dopamine, the “reward” neurochemical, is released when listening to pleasurable music, in exactly the same brain areas and pathways as when receiving primary (food, sex) or secondary (money, status) survival rewards. 

This relationship appears to be causal according to a study by Ferreri and colleagues 2019;  administering a dopamine pill (levodopa) increases experience of musical pleasure and ingesting a dopamine antagonist (risperidone) decreased reported enjoyment. 

English essayist and poet Samuel Johnson once said that "music is the only sensual pleasure without vice". Given how strongly music can stimulate dopamine release in the same way as the 'classical' vices - gluttony, promiscuity, unfaithfulness - Johnson's aphorism is brought into question.

The role of dopamine in reward-related cognition is more complex than just producing pleasure. It is not only released when receiving a reward, but also when one is anticipating a potential desirable reward, such that the build up to a pay off may be satisfying/addictive in itself. 

Think of how a gambler riding the edge of their seat as the roulette ball tumbles around the wheel, or yourself salivating at the thought of the KFC Zinger Box you’ll demolish after reading this post.

Rewards that strongly activate the dopaminergic system seem to play by these rules - pleasure seems to be a combination of the stimuli, thoughts, and experiences in anticipation of the pay-off, and the actual reward itself. 



## So what makes a good song?

Given the strong connection between music and the dopaminergic system, it stands to reason that this same pattern may exist: Dopamine release and pleasure could be modulated by both musical anticipation and eventual reward. 

In the musical realm, one conceptualisation of anticipation is the “buildup” of a song - the gradual increase in volume and intensity, building excitement in the listener as instruments layer upon each other, creating a sense of rising energy. 

The “drop” is one possible reward, the moment when the music reaches its peak, beats and melodies collide with maximum impact, often accompanied by a dynamic change in rhythm or a bass drop. In combination, these two aspects combine to form a sensation of release and catharsis in music. 



## An experimental approach to musical pleasure

Cheung et al. 2019, took a more scientific approach to investigating the components of a “pleasurable” song. Using a machine-learning model, they analysed 80,000 chords in 745 songs on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and attempted to determine what exactly makes an enjoyable chord progression. 

They found that musical enjoyment was modulated by two particular domains: **uncertainty** and **surprise**. 

Uncertainty refers to the anticipation a listener has for the next chord before it is heard. High levels of uncertainty may arise from novel chord sequences within a song. 

Using the example of Taylor Swift’s ‘Love Story’, after the first few verses and chorus, the hopeful, predictable chord progression becomes “Low Uncertainty”, we have got the idea already.
When the first minor chord of the bridge, accompanying the despondent “I grew tired of waiting…” we are struck with a sense of uncertainty - this is a new chord progression and thus we don’t know what to expect. This would be classified as “High Uncertainty.

Surprise, as defined by the study, instead arises when an heard chord deviates from expectations. This notion is particularly familiar to jazz listeners - the “stink face” feeling. That magical moment when a chord or melody is so unexpectedly delectable that it triggers an involuntary facial contortion. 

["An example of the fabled 'stink face'"](https://youtu.be/hXtwHKVX-OY?si=K3DKRcB_G7mNFN3j&t=4v)

Interestingly, the  most musical enjoyment derived from chord progressions wasn’t just when there was a combination of high uncertainty and high surprise as you might have expected (surprise!). 

Instead the sequences that elicited the highest pleasure ratings were those that deviated significantly from what the listener had expected (low uncertainty, high surprise), or conversely, when they conformed to expectations in a uncertain context (high uncertainty, low surprise). 

> Songs we find pleasant are those which strike a good balance between knowing what is going to happen next and surprising us with something we did not expect - Cheung (study author)

### Relating classical and scientific theory

This makes a lot of sense from my perspective - an unexpected chord may be most pleasurable when it catches you off guard, when you have settled into a song, or expect a well-known progression (like the tried and trusted I-V-iv-IV). Leonard Cohen’s Hallelujah demonstrates this in the fourth line “Well it goes like this the fourth, the fifth”, the Am repeated twice earlier is replaced by consecutive uplifting major chords F and G.  

On the flip-side, have a listen to Jimi Hendrix’s ["'Little Wing'"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkEPBiMbgxs). Right off the bat he leads us on a journey with a guitar solo over one of the most unique chord progressions in all of music. The musical path is winding, uncertain, you feel like you are being swept away into uncharted waters. And just when you are least expecting it, he guides us back to the starting chord, like a ship’s anchor finding solid ground.

**Little Wing's chord progression for your interest:**

 E - Bm - Am - C  -  G  - F  - C  - D -  Em

This theory is a gross oversimplification - in Cheung's experiment chord progressions were played as simple sine waves, disregarding the effect that the orchestration of percussion, vocals, and instrumentation can have on a song. 

The study was also limited by the fact that the study parameters of uncertainty and surprise were determined _a priori_, i.e. the researchers had already decided before the experiment that they would be investigating the effects of these two domains on musical pleasure. As such, this relationship can only be described as correlational rather than causal.

It is nonetheless incredible that we can independently replicate one element of traditional musical theory via machine-learning techniques. Perhaps the next step is to identify which combination of lyrics tickles the brain just right, a venture that doesn't seem too unreasonable given the recent explosion in conversational and language AI models. 

Not that we need the explicit approval of AI to enjoy anything (yet...).

### What's next?

Do artists need to exploit these new neuroscientific findings to create fresh, catchy music? 

Of course not. Just as mankind has been creating and enjoying music for millenia, oblivious to this information, we will be able to continue. 

What is exciting, is the idea that AI may be able to extrapolate, rather than interpolate musical ideas, to perhaps reach the next untapped frontier of music.
