## Background

As our population ages and modern medicine progresses, one disease entity continues to march inevitably towards us. Dementia is the second leading cause of all Australians, and forecasts project it to dethrone coronary heart disease in the next few years. It has thus become a priority to elucidate the lifestyle and genetic factors that prevent or reverse cognitive decline. 

**There is some evidence to suggest that higher educational attainment and intelligence are independently protective against the development of Alzheimer's Disease and dementia.**

Brain training, particularly using apps like Lumosity or Elevate, has been a research subject of great interest. While there is a substantial body of evidence suggesting that these apps do not actually "improve" your cognition or intelligence, greater lifetime participation in **cognitively-stimulating activities** (crosswords, puzzles, etc.) does appear to be associated with a lower incidence of Alzheimer's disease. 

This has been described as the **'use it or lose it'** principle. While epidemiological studies certainly suggest a moderate association, there are many questions that remain incompletely answered - Can additional cognitive participation (training) improve cognition or prevent decline? How long do these effects last? Does activity in later life prevent Alzheimer's? Which activities are most beneficial?

My prediction is that as research priorities shift towards dementia prevention and the evidence supporting this principle begins to grow, the government will begin to formally recommend cognitive participation as part of their prevention guidelines. 

## The Challenge

Despite the overly scientific introduction, I am actually here to have a bit of fun. Recently I have experienced an insufferable bout of boredom, which the dreary weather has not helped with. 

I decided to challenge myself today, in the theme of the article, to **ten mental challenges** back-to-back, some designed to stimulate different areas of my cognition, and some just for fun. 

**Here is the line-up:**

1. Wordle Unlimited
2. Anagramania 
3. Chess.com Puzzle Rush
4. Nine Daily Mini Crosswords
5. Sporcle Abbreviations Brain Teaser
6. 6x6 Sudokus
7. Country Capitals Challenge
8. Animal Names Challenge (A-G)
9. Contexto (Semantic similarity)
10. Memorising digits of π

For each challenge I spent exactly 5 minutes. I will explain each challenge briefly and share my results. 

I will also share what I was thinking and feeling during each challenge, hoping to gain some understanding of performance when quickly switching between tasks, what duration and intensity of cognitive load I can handle before my performance deteriorates, and how I react when I get stuck.

**Here were my rules:**
1. 5 minutes for each challenge
2. No external help or internet use
3. Pen and paper on side
4. No giving up early
5. No breaks

**Let's get started!**

## Challenge 1: Wordle Unlimited

Starting with a crowd favourite, Wordle. I used wordle unlimited as the New York Times only releases one a day. 

My strategy was using the same three words every time to maximise the number of letters covered. The three words I've used in the past were "solar", "hunky", and "timed"

I ended up solving 6 wordles, most within 4-5 attempts. In retrospect this isn't much of a brain game if you use this strategy. Perhaps next time you should be forced to use different starting words every time.

## Challenge 2: Anagramania

This next challenge can be found on [this website](https://www.gamesforthebrain.com/game/anagramania/). 

A scrambled word shows on the screen and you have 20 seconds to unscramble it. To make it easier, the first letter is already correct.

A correct answer is worth +10 points and an incorrect -10 points.

This one made me chuckle:

Some were just impossible to me and essentially wasted 20 seconds (see if you can get it!):

And some I surprised myself with:

I got **17 correct and 5 wrong** in the 5 minute period, for a final score of 120. To be honest I mostly just farmed 5-6 letter words for the corrects and lost a lot of time on the longer ones. 

I found that I either solved it within 5 seconds or just mentally gave up - perhaps I need to train my resilience and work at full mental capacity even if I can't instantly get it!


## Challenge 3: Chess.com Puzzle Rush

This one was more for fun.

Chess is a trainable skill and solving puzzles is essentially pattern recognition. I have played these Puzzle Rushes in the past so naturally I am familiar with some of the the patterns

For each of the puzzles you are expected to analyse a position and play the best move. The puzzles increase in difficulty with each one solved:they start off from simple checkmate-in-one puzzles to more complex themes like sacrifices, pins, forks etc. If you make the wrong move three times, the game is over.

![png](/images/challenge/chess1.png)

I solved 18 puzzles correctly before I lost by getting 3 puzzles wrong, with 24 seconds left on the clock. In retrospect, I lost focus towards the middle and played attractive moves but not the best move. 

The time pressure definitely had an impact on my performance, I don't think I would have made the two earlier mistakes if I had taken 5 more seconds.

## Challenge 4: Nine Daily Mini Crosswords

This is my favourite lecture time-wasting activity. If you've sat behind me class you'll see me spamming hundreds of these mini-crosswords in a 5x5 grid.

My strategy is to fill in as many horizontals as I can first, then fill in the gaps using the verticals. The clues are not necessarily easy, but you usually find answers easier using the other filled in letters. Typing speed is relevant because they are so quick, one can take less than 30 seconds. 

Feel free to try one with me:

![png](/images/challenge/crossword1.png)

This was an embarrassing result - I only managed to complete two mini-crosswords in the five minutes. 

The first two took me 45 seconds and 1 minute respectively, however I was absolutely destroyed by this crossword. In retrospect I should have got the Logan one but I just had a brainfart and essentially gave up.

Here are the answers if you're interested (who tf names their kid kalel)

## Challenge 5: Sporcle Abbreviation Brain Teasers

Admittedly I've come across some of these before but this is one of my favourite puzzle types. 

You are given a saying or common grouping that has had certain words initialised - e.g. '29 Days in February in a Leap Year' becomes '29 D in F in a LY'. Your job is to do this in reverse.

Try some for yourself, they give your brain a good work out!

![png](/images/challenge/sporcle1.png)

This is how far I got. I have done this puzzle a long time ago which definitely gave me a few bonus points but still got stuck on quite a few. I was essentially out of ideas by 3 minutes in.

![png](/images/challenge/sporcle2.png)

Here are the answers:

## Challenge 6: 6x6 Sudoku (Hard)

Pretty self-explanatory. I used [this website](https://sudoku.vip/6x6/) and put it on the Hard mode

![png](/images/challenge/sudoku1.png)

I'm not a Sudoku expert: I solved two puzzles fully, and the last one put me over time by 45 seconds.

At this point of the challenge I was almost 30 minutes in and my brain was begging for a break. Fortunately my Mum needed my help moving a couch so I was able to have a quick breather.

## Challenge 7: Capital Cities Middles

Another Sporcle quiz. This one required you to name Capital Cities with a catch - the answers were on the page, but the first and last letter had been removed. 

![png](/images/challenge/capital1.png)

My approach to this one was simply going down the list and answering any of the ones I could solve instantly. Some of the cities with only two letters left were almost impossible, others jumped out instantly. 

Here's my final result (red is the ones I didn't get)
![png](/images/challenge/capital2.png)

I performed 1% below average which is great for the ego considering I thought I had done a good job... I haven't even heard of half the cities in red so I'll count it as a win

## Challenge 8: Animal Naming Challenge (A-G)

For the next 5 minutes I challenged myself to write down the names of as many animals I could think of with names that started with letters A-G.

I was so mentally tired at this point but I persevered. I went in with no real strategy and it showed - there were periods were I was just completely mindblanked for 30+ seconds. 

Eventually I got into a bit more of a flow and started going through mammals, reptiles, birds, insects etc. However the result is still pretty poor - I named **36 animals** in total. 

Some of the answers are a little suspect... (like "Dory" or doubling up "Fox" with "Fennec Fox")

## Challenge 9: Contexto

The next challenge was playing a game called [Contexto](https://contexto.me/).

This game is super fun - I suggest you give it a try. Just like Wordle, every day has a different target word. 

There is a box to guess words - an artificial intelligence algorithm determines the 'semantic similarity' of your guess to the target word and ranks it against all the words of the English language.

For example: if the word of the day is "strong", a word like "gym" might get a ranking of 15, "smart" might get a ranking of 200, and "apple" would get a ranking of 1000+. 

![png](/images/challenge/contexto1.png)

I was led on a bit of a wild goose chase. My first guesses - "child", "class", "teach" - led me to think it was something academic or school related.

I guessed about 20 academic subjects, all of which were not related at all with the target word.

With 1 minute left I just started spamming generic words and got lucky with the word "girl" being ranked 11. 

I quickly typed all the words to do with girls: "clothes", "beauty", "makeup", "pretty" (misogyny in full display) to no avail.

Finally, for some reason I tried "dance" which for some stupid reason was indeed the target word. The timer sounded 3 seconds later!

## Challenge 10: Memorising Digits of π

I don't why I left this challenge to last but I was both physically and mentally exhauasted at this point. I started to get a little bit of a headache.

Fortunately this was a task that I knew I had some hope of being good at.

### My first run in with the law

Funny story from my Year 4 class - the first time I got sent to the Principal's office.

For 'π Day', March the 14th, our class held a competition to see who could memorise the most digits of π. We had 10 minutes at the end of our class and all of recess to do so. 

I must have been a nerdy-ass kid with nerdy-ass friends because I distinctly remember my friends and myself hunched over the same scrunched up sheet of paper, trying to burn those digits into our heads. 

After recess it was showtime. One-by-one we stood up and recited the digits. Some kids clearly could not care less and memorised 4 digits. Some got to 20. 

For some reason my autistic ass was able to memorise 41 digits. My teacher, sadistic as she was, decided that I should be sent to the principal's office to show off this useless skill. 

So now I have this distinct memory of being stood in her office, rattling off digits, while she was clearly busy answering emails or signing reports or whatever principals do. At the end she delivered a half-impressed, half-amused, and fully forced compliment and sent me on my way.

### Have I improved after 16 years?

Having given myself a much shorter time, but also hopefully a little brighter than my 9 year old self. I set off on the mission of memorising these seemingly random digits.

I would say I have a good memory, not because I can inherently remember things well, but because I tend to be good at assigning meaning to randomness. 

This is one memory trick that I tend to use: by associating groups of numbers with a certain label, whether it be semantic, structural, mathematical, or historic, it helps to store things as chunks rather than individual numbers. 

I believe this strategy is called "chunking" - something which I naturally began using from an early age.

![png](/images/challenge/pi1.png)
Above is my attempt to "chunk", I've annotated the labels and associations I've made within each chunk. 

Examples include the numerical similarity of "3238 and 3383", the symmetry of "46264, "2884" being all even numbers and made of two multiples of 7, and "693 993" both containing the repeated "93".

I already knew the first 11 digits of π so technically it shouldn't count but it's my blog so I've decided it will :). 

My mistake was spending too much time encoding the information and not enough time practicing it. I spent three and a half minutes trying to encode the digits you see above, but I didn't leave enough time to actual practise reciting them. 

![png](/images/challenge/pi2.png)

After 5 minutes I tested myself and was able to recall 47 digits (Suck it 9 year-old me!). 

As such, I found myself blanking about two-thirds through my encoded sequence. The chunks that I spent more time brainstorming associations for were more vivid in my memory while the later ones were lost.


## Final words

Anyway this was a fun challenge to myself. I'm surprised at how exhausted I feel - working at near-100% cognitive load for less than an hour has made me feel more spent than a full day of university lectures. I think I'm going to lie down...

Mentally-stimulating puzzles and challenges have always appealed to me; I'm hoping the research is right and this means I'm protected from dementia... 

I don't really think there's enough evidence to recommend stimulating your mind just for this purpose, but I would personally recommend it just to switch up from the mundane, low-cognitive-demand tasks that tends to populate our day-to-day lives (This is not a bad thing - we can't operate at full power all the time!) - using the incredible flexibility, creativity, and ingenuity of your brain can be lots of fun!

I've chosen tasks that I have fun doing and consider myself pretty practised at; I would definitely not do as well in a series of challenges proposed by someone else. Along the way I've gained some insight on how much brain works under time pressure, when cognitively exhausted, and when switching between different cognitive tasks. 

Most importantly, I've chipped away a little of my boring day. Only 14 more hours to go!
